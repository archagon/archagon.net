This is the second Jekyll post. The intent here is to test all the power features I intend to use in my blog, among them header images, category highlighting, code, article layout, and more.

For the first paragraph, let's test some images.

Now, let's test this code snippet. Below is an example of some pretty terrible code in a language I just made up.

    varbal b set 20
    for varbal c in b [
        b plag 5
        b plag plag
        if b egwal 5 [
            retarn
        ]
    ]
