  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This is the time of year when a lot of people are upgrading their phones. If you are, don’t chuck your old phone just yet!</p>

<p>Here’s a thing you might not know about your iPhone<sup id="fnref:WhyNotAndroid"><a href="#fn:WhyNotAndroid" class="footnote">1</a></sup>: the GPS unit works even without a data connection. I was confused for a long time about what “assisted GPS” actually meant. My understanding was that it was impossible for an AGPS phone (which the iPhone is) to acquire a GPS signal without a data connection. Turns out it works fine — you just have to wait a bit longer for the phone to find a satellite.</p>

<p>So here’s what I do with my old iPhone 4. Whenever I set out for a walk, I load up an app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/mytracks-the-gps-logger/id358697908?mt=8">myTracks</a> and hit the Record button. Then I chuck the phone in my bag and forget about it. At the end of the day, I retrieve the phone — more often than not with plenty of charge remaining — and stop the recording. Finally, I can connect my phone to my computer and export this data as a <code>kml</code> file (among several others) to use with Google Maps:</p>

<p>
<style type="text/css">
    #google-map-sel_20140918old_iphone_tricks_gps_tracker-newcastle_testkml { width: 100%; height: 400px; margin: 0; padding: 0;}
</style>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyCVe3O2OawYpG6wixMFLsdbmnLBsJgSuNA">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    function initialize() {
        var fullPath = 'http://beta-blog.archagon.net/assets/kml/newcastle_test.kml'
        var mapOptions = {
            // center: { lat: 54.966667, lng: -1.6 },
            // zoom: 14,
            // mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
        };
        var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('google-map-sel_20140918old_iphone_tricks_gps_tracker-newcastle_testkml'),
            mapOptions);
        var kmzLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(fullPath);
        kmzLayer.setMap(map);
    }
    google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);
</script>
<div id="google-map-sel_20140918old_iphone_tricks_gps_tracker-newcastle_testkml"></div>
<noscript></noscript>
</p>

<p>(Incidentally, setting this viewer up was surprisingly easy. First, I exported the <code>kml</code> data from the app — in this case, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easytrails-gps-lite/id325929832?mt=8">EasyTrailsLT</a>, which I’m also trying out. Next, I went and got a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google Maps Javascript API key</a>. Finally, I wrote a quick Jekyll plugin to replace <code>kmlasset</code> tags with a bit of boilerplate Javascript code that calls Google Maps. End result: I can drop my <code>kml</code> in a folder, add a tag, and have the map show up magically in my blog post. This is just a small example of how Jekyll makes doing data-heavy blogging a lot more simple, which I’ll delve into in later posts!)</p>

<p>Most of the GPS apps I’ve looked at still support iOS5, so your phone doesn’t even have to be a recent model. I’d still use my 3GS for this purpose if the battery was up to snuff.</p>

<p>People always panic when Google or Apple slips up and caches a bit of your location data, but I feel the opposite. With an old iPhone and just a bit of dilligence, I can create a map of everywhere I’ve walked in the world!</p>
