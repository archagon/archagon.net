This is my work-in-progress Jekyll blog, eventually meant to supplant both my Squarespace blog (<http://www.archagon.net>) and my programming blog (<http://www.abstractrose.net>). At the moment it's under heavy construction, hence unfinished appearance and the beta-blog subdomain. But that doesn't mean it's not open to readership!

Once I finish the initial design and port all my old posts over, I'll change the base URL to just archagon.net and redirect the beta-blog subdomain there. This hopefully means that all the beta permalinks will continue to work in perpetuity.
