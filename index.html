          <p class="post-excerpt"><p>I recently released my first commercial project: <a href="http://translit-keyboard.archagon.net">Translit Keyboard</a>, a 3rd party keyboard for iPhone that lets you transliterate Latin characters into Cyrillic and some other alphabets. When I was first investigating this problem, around the time that iOS 7 came out, I discovered that I could implement an elegant solution in OSX using the lesser-known <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/Mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/InputMethodKitFrameworkRef/index.html">Input Method Kit</a>. My program sat between the keyboard and text field; the framework provided me with each raw character as it was entered, and I could either pass it along with the default behavior, or instead take control of the output and send off whatever I pleased<sup id="fnref:other_translit_techniques"><a href="#fn:other_translit_techniques" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Sadly, iOS was off-limits: since 3rd party extensions weren’t even on the radar at the time, there was nothing anyone could do to enable this sort of behavior system-wide. The only solution was to make a nice app with a special text field that you could copy and paste from — too clunky for rapid-pace tasks like messaging.</p>

      <p>There were a number of other interesting ways to accomplish the same goal, including Quartz event taps and <code>.keylayout</code> files. You can check out the code, in various states of completion, in <a href="https://github.com/archagon/cyrillic-transliterator">my Github repo</a>.
