(Sorry about the length! At some point in the distant past, this was supposed to be a short blog post. If you like, you can skip straight to the [demo section][sec-demo] which will get to the point faster than anything else.)

Embarrassingly, most my app development to date has been confined to local devices. Programmers like to gloat about the stupendous mental castles they build of their circutous, multi-level architectures, but not me. In truth, networks leave me quite perplexed. I start thinking about data serializing to bits, servers performing secret handshakes and negotiating history, merge conflicts pushing into app-space and starting the whole process over againâ€”and it all just turns to mush in my head. For peace of mind, my code needs to be *locally provable*, and this means things like idempotent functions, immediate mode rendering, contiguous memory, immutable data. Networks, unfortunately, throw a giant wrench in the works.

Sometime last year, after realizing that most of my ideas for document-based apps would probably require CloudKit for sync and collaboration, I decided to finally take a stab at the problem. Granted, there were tons of frameworks that promised to do the hard work of data model replication for me, but I didn't want to black-box the most important part of my code. My gut told me that there had to be some arcane bit of knowledgeâ€”some *foundational abstraction*â€”that would allow me to network my documents in a more refined and functional way, without the stateful spaghetti of conventional network architectures. Instead of downloading a Github framework and [smacking the build button](http://amzn.to/2iigBOI), I wanted to develop a base set of skills that would allow me to easily network *any* document-based app in the future, even if I was starting from scratch.

<!--more-->

The first order of business was to devise a wishlist for my fantastical system:

* Most obviously, users should be able to edit their documents immediately, without even touching the network. (In other words, the system should only require *optimistic concurrency*.)
* Sync should happen in the background, entirely separate from the main application code, and any remote changes should be seamlessly integrated in real-time. (Put another way, sync should be treated as a kind of progressive enchancement.)
* Merge should always be automatic, even for concurrent edits. The user should never be faced with a "pick the correct revision" dialog box.
* A user should be able to work on their document offline for an indefinite period of time without accruing "sync debt". (Meaning that if, for example, sync is accomplished by way of an operation log, performance should not suffer even if a user spends a month offline and then sends all their hundreds of changes at once.) 
* Secondary data structures and state should be minimized. Most of the extra information required for sync should be stored in the same place as the document, and moving the document to a new device should not break sync. (No out-of-band metadata or caches!)
* Network back-and-forth should be condensed down to a bare minimum, and rollbacks and re-syncs should practically never happen. To the greatest possible degree, network communication should be stateless and dumb.
* To top it all off, my chosen technique had to pass the "PhD Test". That is to say, one shouldn't need a PhD to understand and implement the chosen approach for custom data models.

After musing over my bullet points, it occurred to me that the network problems I was dealing withâ€”cloud sync, editing across multiple devices, real-time collaboration, offline support, and reconciliation of distant or conflicting revisionsâ€”were all really different facets the same problem. Namely: how do we design a system such that any two revisions of the same document could always be merged deterministically and sensibly without requiring user intervention? Was such a thing even possible?

To start with, a document could be viewed as a collection of basic data fields: registers, sequences, dictionaries, and so forth. From the perspective of something like a distributed database, it was actually quite trivial to resolve conflicts across the network in this kind of row: just keep overwriting each field with the version sporting the highest timestamp. Of course, for anything other than basic registers, this was a terrible approach. Sequences and dictionaries weren't blobs of homogenous data, but complex, mutable structures that users were directly manipulatingâ€”not just overwriting with each change. On merge, with databases and plain files alike, the common solution was to simply punt any conflicts to app-space so that a human could deal with them. But if these mutations were defined in terms of lower-level operations specific to each data type, could that information perhaps be leveraged to implement automatic conflict resolution?

In hope of uncovering some prior art, I started by looking at the proven leader in the field, Google Docs. Venturing down the deep rabbit hole of [real-time collaborative editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor) techniques, I discovered that many of the problems I faced fell under the umbrella of [strong eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). Unlike the more conventional [strong consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency) model, where all clients receive changes in identical order and rely on locking to some degree, strong *eventual* consistency allows clients to individually diverge and then arrive at a final, consistent result once each update has been received. (Or, in a word, when the network is *quiescent*.)

There were a number of tantalizing techniques to investigate in this field, and I kept several questions in mind for my analysis. Could a given technique be generalized to arbitrary document formats and data types? Did the technique pass the PhD Test? And was it possible to use the technique in an architecture with smart clients and dumb servers?

The reason for that last question was CloudKit Sharing, a framework introduced in iOS 10. For the most part, this framework functioned as a superset of regular CloudKit, requiring only minor code changes to enable document sharing in an app. A developer didn't even have to worry about connecting users or showing custom UI: Apple did most of the hard work in the background and leveraged standard system dialogs to make it work. But almost two years later, [on the order of no one](https://github.com/search?l=Swift&q=UICloudSharingController&type=Code&utf8=âœ“) seemed to be using it. Why was this? After all, most Apple APIs tended to be readily adopted, especially when they allowed the developer to expand into system areas which were normally out of bounds. 

My hunch was that CloudKit Sharing forced the issue of real-time collaboration over a relatively dumb channel, which was a problem outside the purview of conventional sync approaches. CloudKit allowed developers to easily store, retrieve, and listen for new data, but not much else besides. Concurrent editing made this a problem. Unlike in the single-user/multi-device case, you couldn't just pop up a merge dialog every time somebody touched your open document. But you also couldn't resolve conflicts on the server side, since CloudKit did not permit developers to run custom code on their end. The only remaining options seemed to be some sort of ugly, heuristic auto-merge or data-dropping last-write-wins, neither of which was palatable by modern standards. Real-time collaboration along the lines of Google Docs appeared to be impossible using this system! But was it really?

I realized that this was my prize to be won. If I could figure out a way to develop auto-merging documents, I'd be able to implement sync and collaboration in my apps over CloudKit for free while also adopting Apple's first-party sharing UI. So this became my ultimate research goal: a collaborative iPhone text editing demo that synced entirely over Apple's servers. (And here's a spoiler: [it worked!][sec-demo])

# Convergence Techniques: A High-Level Overview

There are a few basic terms that are critical to understanding eventual consistency. The first is **causality**. An operation is *caused* by another operation when it directly modifies or otherwise involves the results of that operation, and determining causality is critical for reconstructing a sensible timeline (or **linearization**) of operations across the network. (An operation that causes another operation must always be ordered first.) However, we can't always determine direct causality in a general way, so algorithms often assume that an operation is causally ahead of another operation if the site generating the newer operation has already seen the older operation on creation. (In other words, every operation seen by a site at the time a new operation is created is in that operation's *causal past*.) This "soft" causality can be determined using a variety of schemes. The simplest is a [Lamport timestamp][lamport], which requires that every new operation have a higher Lamport timestamp than every other known operation, including any remote operations received. (Note that this approach is stateless. As long as each operation retains its Lamport timestamp, you don't need any extra data in the system to determine causality.) Although there are eventual consistency schemes that can receive operations in any order, most algorithms rely on operations arriving at each site in their **causal order** (e.g. `insert A` necessarily arriving before `delete A`). When discussing convergence schemes, we can often assume causal order since it can be implemented fairly mechanically on the transport layer. If two operations are not causalâ€”if they were created simultaneously on different sites without knowledge of each otherâ€”they are said to be **concurrent**. An operation log in causal order can be described as having a **partial order**, since concurrent operations might be in different positions on different clients. If the log is guaranteed to be identical on all clients, it has a **total order**. Most of the hard work in eventual consistency involves reconciling and ordering these concurrent operations. Generally speaking, concurrent operations have to be made to **commute**, or have the same effect on the data regardless of their order of arrival. This can be done in a variety of ways[^commutes].

[^commutes]: Although it's most intuitive to think of individual operations as commuting (or not), commutativity is actually a property of the entire system as a whole and can be specified in many places. For example, a data structure might be entirely composed of operations that are naturally commutative (e.g. only addition), in which case nothing more needs to be done. Or: the system might be designed such that every event is uniquely timestamped, identified, and placed in a totally-ordered event log, which can then be re-parsed whenever remote changes are inserted before the endpoint. Or: the system might still be event-based, but instead of keeping around an event log, incoming concurrent operations are altered to ensure that their effect on the data structure is identical regardless of their order of arrival. So even if two operations might not be *naturally* commutative, they could still be made to commute *in effect* through a variety of methods. The trick is making sure that these "commutativity transformations" produce sensible results.

Now, there are two competing approaches in strong eventual consistency state-of-the-art, both tagged with rather unappetizing initialisms: [Operational Transformation][ot] (OT) and [Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types][crdt] (CRDTs). Fundamentally, these approaches tackle the same problem. Given an object that has been edited by an arbitrary number of connected devices, how do we coalesce and apply their changes in a consistent way, even when those changes might be concurrent or arrive out of order? And, moreover, what do we do if a user goes offline for a long time, or if the network is unstable, or even if we're in a peer-to-peer environment with no single source of truth?

## Operational Transformation

[Operational Transformation][ot] is the proven leader in the field, notably used by Google Docs and (now Apache) Wave as well as Etherpad and ShareJS. Unfortunately, it is only "proven" insofar as you have a company with billions of dollars and hundreds of PhDs at hand, as the problem is *hard*. With OT, each user has their own copy of the data, and each atomic mutation is called an **operation**. (For example, `insert A at index 2` or `delete index 3`.) Whenever a user mutates their data, they send their new operation to all their peers, often in practice through a central server. OT generally makes the assumption that the data is a black box and that incoming operations will be applied directly on top without the possibility of a rebase operation. Consequently, the only way to ensure that concurrent operations will commute in their effect is to **transform** them depending on their order.

Let's say Peer A inserts a character in a string at position 3, while Peer B simultaneously deletes a character at position 2. If Peer C, who has the original state of the string, receives A's edit before B's, everything is peachy keen. If B's edit arrives first, however, A's insertion will be in the wrong spot. A's insertion position will therefore have to be transformed by subtracting the length of B's edit. This is fine for the simple case of two switched edits, but it gets a whole lot more complicated when you start dealing with more than a single pair of concurrent changes. (An algorithm that deals with this caseâ€”and thus, [provably][cp2], with any conceivable caseâ€”is said to be have the "CP2/TP2" property rather than the pairwise "CP1/TP1" property. Yikes, where are professional namers when you need them?) In fact, the majority of published algorithms for string OT actually have subtle bugs in certain edge cases (such as the so-called "[dOPT puzzle][dopt]"), meaning that they aren't strictly convergent without occasional futzing and re-syncing by way of a central server. And while the idea that you can treat your model objects strictly in terms of operations is elegant in its premise, the fact that adding a new operation to the schema requires figuring out its interactions with *every existing operation* is nearly impossible to grapple with.

## Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types

[Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types][crdt] are the new hotness in the field. In contrast to OT, the CRDT approach considers sync in terms of the underlying data structures, not sequences of operations. AÂ CRDT, at a high level, is a type of object that can be merged with any objects of the same type, in arbitrary order, to produce an identical union object. CRDT merge must be associative, commutative, and idempotent, and the resulting CRDT of each mutation or merge must be "greater" than than all its inputs. (Mathematically, this flow is said to form a *monotonic semilattice*.) As long as each connected peer eventually receives the updates of every other peer, the results will provably convergeâ€”even if one peer happens to be a month behind. This might sound like a tall order, but you're already aware of several simple CRDTs. For example, no matter how you permute the merge order of any number of insert-only sets, you'll still end up with the same union set in the end. Really, the concept is quite intuitive!

Of course, simple sets aren't enough to represent arbitrary data, and much of CRDT research is dedicated to finding new and improved ways of implementing sequence CRDTs, often under the guise of string editing. Algorithms vary, but this is often accomplished by giving each individual letter its own unique identifier, then giving each letter a reference to its intended neighbor instead of dealing with indices. On deletion, letters are usually replaced with **tombstones** (placeholders), allowing an operation that deletes a character and another that references it to concurrently execute. This does tend to mean that sequence CRDTs perpetually grow in proportion to the number of deleted characters in a document, though there are various ways of dealing with this accumulated garbage.

One last thing to note is that there are actually two kinds of CRDTs: CmRDTs and CvRDTs. (Seriously, there's got to be a better way to name these things...) CmRDTs, or operation-based CRDTs, only require peers to send each other their changes[^op-crdt], but place some constraints on the transport layer. (For instance, exactly-once and/or causal delivery, depending on the CmRDT in question.) With CvRDTs, or state-based CRDTs, peers send each other their full data objects and then merge them locally, placing no constraints on the transport layer but taking up more bandwidth and possibly CPU time. Both types of CRDT are equivalent and can be converted to either form.

[^op-crdt]: This might sound a lot like Operational Transformation! Superficially, the approach is very similar, but the operations don't have to be transformed since the data structures already have commutativity built in. `insert B to the right of A` does not change its meaning even in the presence of concurrent operations, so long as A leaves a tombstone once it's been deleted. Again, we're focused on the data structures here. Their design comes first, and all the other parts follow.

## Differential Synchronization

There's actually one more technique that's worth discussing, and it's a bit of an outlier. This is Neil Fraser's [Differential Synchronization][diffsync]. Used in an earlier version of Google Docs before their flavor of OT was implemented, Differential Sync uses [contextual diffing][context-diff] between local revisions of documents to generate streams of frequent, tiny edits between peers. If there's a conflict, the receiving peer uses [fuzzy patching][fuzzy-patch] to apply the incoming changes as best as possible, then contextually diffs the resulting document with a reproduced copy of the sender's document (using a cached "shadow copy" of the last seen version) and sends the new changes back. This establishes a sort of incremental sync loop. Eventually, all peers converge on a final, stable document state. Unlike with OT and CRDTs, the end result is not mathematically defined, but instead relies on the organic behavior of the fuzzy patching algorithm when faced with diffs of varying contexts and sizes.

## Finding the Best Approach

Going into this problem, my first urge was to adopt Differential Sync. One might complain that this algorithm has too many subjective bits for production use, but that's exactly what appealed to me about it. Merge is a complicated process that often relies on heuristics entirely separate from the data format. A human would merge two list documents and two prose documents very differently, even though they might both be represented as text. With Differential Sync, all this complex logic is encapsulated in the diff and patch functions. Much like git, the system is content-focused in the sense that the resulting patches don't have any particular insight into the inner workings of the data type. The implementation of the data format could be refactored as needed, and the diff and patch functions could be tweaked and improved over time, and neither system would have to know about changes to the other. It also means that the documents in their original form could be preserved in their entirety server-side, synergizing nicely with Dropbox-style cloud backup. It felt like the perfect dividing line of abstraction.

But studying Differential Sync further, I realized that a number of details made it a non-starter. First, though the approach seems simple on the surface, its true complexity is concealed by the implementation of diff and patch. This class of algorithm works well for strings, but you basically need to be a seasoned algorithms expert to design one for a new data type. (Worse: the inherent fuzziness depends on non-objective metrics, so you might only figure out the effectiveness of new diff and patch algorithms after prolonged use and testing, not through formal analysis.) Second, diffing and patching as they currently exist are really meant for loosely-structured data formats such as strings and images. Barring conversion to text-based intermediary formats, tightly structured data would be very difficult to diff and patch while maintaining consistency. Next, there are some issues with using Differential Sync in an offline-first environment. Clients have to store their entire diff history while offline, and then, on reconnection, send the whole batch to their peers for a very expensive merge. Worse yet, assuming that other sites had been editing away in the meantime, distantly-divergent versions would very likely fail to merge on account of out-of-date context information in the diffs and lose much of the data for the reconnected peer. Finally, Differential Sync only allows one packet at a time to be in flight between two peers. If there are network issues, the whole thing grinds to a halt.

Begrudgingly, I had to abandon the elegance of Differential Sync and decide between the two deterministic approaches. CRDTs raised some troubling questions, including the impact of per-letter metadata and the necessity of tombstones in most sequence CRDTs. You could end up with a file that looked tiny (or even empty) but was in fact enormous under the hood. However, OT was a no-go right from the start. One, the event-based system would have been untenable to build on top of a simple database like CloudKit. You really needed active servers or peer-to-peer connections for that. And two, I discovered that the few known sequence OT algorithms guaranteed to converge in all casesâ€”the ones with the coveted CP2/TP2 propertyâ€”ended up relying on tombstones anyway! (If you're interested, Raph Levien touches on this curious overlap [in this article][convergence].) So it didn't really matter which choice I made. If I wanted the resiliency of a provably convergent system, I had to deal with metadata-laden data structures that left some trace of their deleted elements.

And with their focus on data over process, CRDTs pointed to a paradigm shift in networked computing. A document format based on CRDTsâ€”a voraciously-mergable "golden file"â€”would push network issues completely of the way. The system would be completely functional, even in communication with remote devices. You'd be able to throw different versions of the same file together in any order to obtain the same merge result, never once having to ask anything of the user. Everything would work without quirks in offline mode regardless of how much time had passed. Instead of dealing with the endless headaches of coordination, data could be promiscuously streamed to any device listening for changes. The document would be topology-agnostic to such a degree that you could use it in a peer-to-peer environment, send it between phone and laptop via Bluetooth, share it with multiple local applications, and sync it through a traditional central database. All at the same time!

Here, a wily political thought crossed my mind. Could this be the chance to finally break free from the shackles of the cloud? It always felt like such an affront that my data had to snake through a tangle of corporate servers in order to reach the device next to me. We used to happily share files across applications and even operating systems, and now everything was funneled through these monolithic black boxes. What happened? How did we let computing become so darn *undemocratic*? It had gotten so bad that we *expected* our data and workflows to vanish whenever a startup got itself acquired!

CRDTs promised document formats the power to take on full responsibility over sync and collaboration, reverting the server from its gatekeeper role into a dumb, hot-swappable conduit. With this technology, we could return data to the control of its users once more! But the road here was fresh and unpaved, and I needed to figure out if I could use these structures in a performant and space-efficient way for non-trivial applications.

<figcaption>The mythical, eminently-mergable golden file in its adventures through the semilattice.</figcaption>
</figure>

The next step was to read through the academic literature on CRDTs. There was a group of usual suspects for the hard case of sequence (text) CRDTs: [WOOT][woot], [Treedoc][treedoc], [Logoot][logoot]/[LSEQ][lseq], and [RGA][rga]. WOOT is the progenitor of the genre and makes each character in a string reference its adjacent neighbors on both sides. Recent analysis has shown this to be inefficient compared to newer approaches. Treedoc has a similar early-adoptor performance penalty and additionally requires coordination for its garbage collectionâ€”a no-go for true decentralization. Logoot (which is optimized further by LSEQ) curiously avoids tombstones by treating each sequence item as a unique point along a dense (infinitely-divisible) number line, and in exchange adopts item identifiers (similar to bignums) which have unbounded growth. Unfortunately, it has a problem with [interleaved text on concurrent edits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45722742/logoot-crdt-interleaving-of-data-on-concurrent-edits-to-the-same-spot). RGA makes each character implicitly reference its intended leftmost neighbor and uses a hash table to make character lookup efficient. It also features an additional update operation alongside the usual insert and delete. This approach often comes out ahead in benchmark comparisons, though the paper is annoyingly dense in theory. I also found a couple of recent, non-academic CRDT designs such as [Y.js][yjs] and [xi][xi], both of which bring something new to the table but feel rather convoluted in comparison to the good-enough RGA. In almost all cases, conflicts between concurrent changes were resolved by way of a creator UUID plus a logical timestamp per character. Sometimes, they were discarded when an operation was applied; other times, they persisted even after merge.

Reading the literature was highly educational, and I now had a good intuition about the behavior of convergent sequence CRDTs. But I just couldn't find very much in common between the disparate approaches. Each one brought its own operations, proofs, optimizations, conflict resolution methods, and garbage collection schemes to the table. Many of the papers blurred the line between theory and implementation, making it even harder to suss out any underlying principles. I felt confident using these algorithms for convergent arrays, but I wasn't quite sure how to build my own convergent data structures using the same principles.

Finally, I discovered the one key CRDT that made things click for me.

# Causal Trees

A a state-based CvRDT, on a high level, can be viewed as a data blob along with a commutative, associative, and idempotent merge function that can always generate a monotonically-farther third blob from any given two. An operation-based CmRDT, meanwhile, can be viewed as a data blob together with a stream of commutative-in-effect (and perhaps causally-ordered) operations that mutate and monotonically push it forward. Could these two systems be combined? Can we treat the data blob as something other than a black box?

Say you're designing a sequence CvRDT from scratch. Instead of picking an existing sequence CRDT, you've been wickedly tempted by the operational approach of CmRDTs! You wonder if it's possible to take those CmRDT operations and fold them into an efficient CvRDT data structure, combining the benefits of a ubiquitously-mergable data structure with the flexibility and expressiveness of defining your model in terms of atomic operations.

To have some data to work with, here's an example of a concurrent string mutation.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/network-chart.svg" style="width:40rem">
<figcaption><span markdown="1">The small numbers over the letters are [Lamport timestamps][lamport].</span></figcaption>
</figure>

Site 1 types "CMD", sends its changes to Site 2 and Site 3, then resumes its editing. Sites 2 and 3 then make their own changes and send them back to Site 1 for the final merge. The result, "CTRLALTDEL", is the most intuitive merge we might expect: insertions and deletions all persist, runs of characters don't split up, and most recent changes come first.

First idea: just take the standard set of array operations (`insert A at index 0`, `delete index 3`, etc.), turn each operation into its own immutable struct, stick the structs into an array in their creation order, and read them back to reconstruct the original array as needed. (In other words, define your CvRDT to be an event log.) This won't be convergent by default since there needs to be some way to establish a total order of operations when merging two such arrays, but it's easy to fix this by giving each operation a globally-unique ID in the form of an owner UUID[^uuid] plus a Lamport timestamp. With this scheme, no two operations can ever have the same ID: operations from the same owner will have different timestamps, while operations from different owners will have different UUIDs. The Lamport timestamps will order operations causally while the UUID will be used for tiebreaking when concurrent operations have the same Lamport timestamp. Now, when a new operational array arrives from a remote peer, the merge is as simple as iterating through both arrays and shifting any new operations to their proper spots: an elementary merge sort.

[^uuid]: Note that UUIDs with the right bit-length don't really need coordination to ensure uniqueness. If your UUID is long enoughâ€”128 bits, let's sayâ€”randomly finding two UUIDs that collide would require generating a billion UUIDs every second for decades. Most applications probably don't need to worry about this possibility. If they do, UUIDs might need to be generated and agreed upon out-of-band. Fortunately, there's very often a way to get a UUID from the OS or the network layer.

<div class="mostly-full-width"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/indexed.svg"></div>

Success: it's an operation-based, fully-convergent CvRDT! Well, sort of. There are two major issues here. First, reconstructing the original array by processing the full operational array has *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) complexity[^complexity], and it has to happen on every key press to boot. Second, intent is completely clobbered. Reading the operations back, we get something along the lines of "CTRLDATLEL" (with a bit of handwaving when it comes to inserts past the array bounds). Just because a data structure converges doesn't mean it makes a lick of sense! As shown in the earlier OT section, concurrent index-based operations can be made to miss their intended characters depending on the order. (Recall that this is the problem OT solves by transforming operations, but here our operations are immutable.) In a sense, this is because the operations are specified incorrectly. They make an assumption that doesn't get encoded in the operations themselvesâ€”that an index can always uniquely identify a characterâ€”and thus lose the commutativity of their intent when this turns out not to be the case. 

[^complexity]: Throughout the rest of this article, *n* will generally refer to the total number of operations in a data structure, while *s* will refer to the total number of sites.

OK, so the first step is to fix the intent problem. Fundamentally, `insert A at index 0` isn't *really* what the user wants to do. People don't think in terms of indices. They want to insert a character at the cursor position, which is perceived as being between two lettersâ€”or more simply, to the immediate right of a single letter. We can encode this by switching our operations to the format <code>insert A<sup>id</sup> after B<sup>id</sup></code>, where each letter in the array is uniquely identified. Given causal order and assuming that deleted characters persist as tombstones, the intent of the operations is now commutative: there will only ever be that one specific 'B' in the array, allowing us to always position 'A' just as the user intended.

So how do we identify a particular letter? Just 'A' and 'B' are ambiguous, after all. We could generate a new ID for each inserted letter, but this isn't necessary: we already have unique UUID/timestamp identifiers for all our operations. Why not just use operation identifiers as proxies for their output? In other words, an `insert A` operation could stand for that particular letter 'A' when referenced by other operations. Now, no extra data is required, and everything is still defined in terms of our original atomic and immutable operations.

<div class="mostly-full-width"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/causal.svg"></div>

This is significantly better than before! We now get "CTRLALTDEL" correctly ordered and even preserving character runs as desired. But performance is still an issue. As it stands, the output array would still take *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) to reconstruct. The main roadblock is that array insertions and deletions tend to be *O*(*n*) operations, and we need to replay our entire history whenever remote changes come in or when we're recreating the output array from scratch. Array *push* and *pop*, on the other hand, are only *O*(1) amortized. What if instead of sorting our entire operational array by timestamp+UUID, we positioned operations in the order of their output? This could be done by placing each operation to the right of its causal operation (parent), then sorting it in reverse timestamp+UUID order among the remaining operations[^rga]. In effect, this would cause the operational array to mirror the structure of the output array. The result would be identical to the previous approach, but the speed of execution would be substantially improved.

[^rga]: In fact, this is also how the RGA algorithm does its ordering, though it's not described in terms of explicit operations and uses a different format for the metadata.

<div class="mostly-full-width"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/causal-ordered.svg"></div>

With this new order, local operations require a bit of extra processing when getting inserted into the operational array. Instead of simply appending to the back, they have to first locate their parent, then find their spot among the remaining operations: *O*(*n*) instead of *O*(1). In return, producing the output array is now only *O*(*n*), since we can read the operations in order and (mostly) push/pop elements in the output array as we go along[^deleteref]. In fact, we can almost treat this operational array *as if it were the string itself*, even going as far as using it as a backing store for a fully-functional `NSMutableString` subclass (with some performance caveats). The operations are no longer just instructions, but also the output data!

(Observe that throughout this process, we have not added any extra data to our operation structs. We have simply arranged the operations in a more precise causal order than the basic timestamp+UUID sort, which is possible because we're aware of the precise causal characteristics of our data model. For example, we know that no matter how high a timestamp an insert operation might have, its final position in the string is solely determined by its parent and any concurrent (sibling) sequences of operations with a higher timestamp+UUID. Every other operation in timestamp+UUID order between that operation and its parent is irrelevant, even though the Lamport timestamps might conservatively imply otherwise. This means that an inserted character in this order can be placed just as it is read. In other words: the Lamport timestamp is a convenient upper bound on causality, but we can do a lot better with domain knowledge.)

[^deleteref]: There's that one delete at S1@T7 that requires backtracking, but we can fix it by using a priority flag for that operation type. More on that later.

Pulled out of its containing array, we can see that what we've designed is, in fact, an operational *tree*â€”one which happens to be implicitly stored as a depth-first, in-order traversal in contiguous memory. Concurrent edits are sibling branches. Subtrees are runs of characters. By the nature of reverse timestamp+UUID sort, sibling subtrees are sorted in the order of their head operations.

This is the underlying premise of the Causal Tree CRDT.

In contrast to all the other CRDTs I'd been looking into, the design presented in Victor Grishchenko's [brilliant paper][ct] was simultaneously clean, performant, and consequential. Instead of dense layers of theory and complex data structures, everything was centered around the idea of atomic, immutable, and globally unique operations, stored in low-level data structures and directly usable as the data they represented. From this, entire classes of features effortlessly followed.

The rest of the paper will be describing [my own CT implementation in Swift](https://github.com/archagon/crdt-playground/blob/269784032d01dc12bd46d43caa5b7047465de5ae/CRDTFramework), incorporating most of the concepts in the original paper but with tweaks to certain details based on further research.

In CT parlance, the operation structs that make up the tree are called **atoms**. Each atom has a unique **identifier** comprised of a **site** UUID, **index**, and Lamport **timestamp**[^awareness]. The index and timestamp serve the same role of logical clock, and the data structure could be made to work with one or the other in isolation. The reason to have both is to enable certain optimizations: the index for *O*(1) atom lookups by identifier, and the timestamp for *O*(1) causality queries between atoms. The heart of an atom is its **value**, which defines the behavior of the given operation and stores any relevant data. For an insert operation, this would be the new character to place, while delete operations contain no extra data. An atom also has a **cause** (or parent), which is the identifier of the atom it is said to "follow". As explained earlier, this causal link simply represents the character to the left of an insertion or the target of a deletion. Assuming that the site is stored in 2 bytes[^uuid2], the index in 4 bytes, and the timestamp in 4 bytes, each character in a basic Causal Tree string is, at minimum, 12Ã— the size of an ordinary C-string character.

[^awareness]: In the original paper, atoms don't have Lamport timestamps, only indices, and atoms are compared by their **awareness** instead of by timestamp. An atom's awareness is a [version vector][versionvector] (called a **weft**) that encompasses all the previous atoms its site would have known about at the time of its creation. This value is derived by recursively combining the awareness of the atom's parent with the awareness of the previous atom in its **yarn** (ordered sequence of atoms for a given site). Though awareness gives us more information than a simple Lamport timestamp, it is also *O*(*n*)â€“slow to derive and makes certain functions (such as validation and merge) substantially more complex. The 4 extra bytes per atom for the Lamport timestamp is therefore a worthwhile tradeoff, and also one which the author of the paper has used in [subsequent work][ron].

[^uuid2]: I mentioned earlier that UUIDs should use on the order of 128 bits to ensure uniqueness. However, having two 128-bit UUIDs per character is simply untenable. The compression scheme I devised for this problem is described further below.

In Swift code, an atom might look something like this:

```swift
struct Id: Codable, Hashable
{
    let site: UInt16
    let index: UInt32
    let timestamp: UInt32
}

struct Atom<T: Codable>: Codable
{
    let id: Id
    let cause: Id
    let value: T
}
```

While a string value might look like this:

```swift
enum StringValue: Codable
{
    case null
    case insert(char: UInt16)
    case delete
  
    // insert Codable boilerplate here
}

typealias StringAtom = Atom<StringValue>
```

(What's great about this representation is that Swift automatically compresses enums with associated values to their smallest possible byte size, i.e. the size of the largest associated value plus a byte for the case, or even less if Swift can determine that a value type has some extra bits available.)

For convenience, a CT begins with a "zero" root atom, and the ancestry of each subsequent atom can ultimately be traced back to it. The depth-first, in-order traversal of our operational tree is called a **weave**, equivalent to the operational array discussed earlier. Instead of representing our tree as an inefficient tangle of pointers, we store it in memory as this weave array. Additionally, since we know the creation order of every atom on each site by way of its index (or timestamp), and since a CT by definition is not allowed to contain any causal gaps, we can always derive a given site's exact sequence of operations from the beginning of time. This sequence of site-specific atoms in creation order is called a **yarn**. While yarns are more of a cache than a primary data structure in a CT, I keep them around together with the weave to enable *O*(1) atom lookups. To pull up an atom based on its identifier, all you have to do is grab the site's yarn array and read out the atom at the identifier's index.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/yarns.svg" style="width:53rem">
<figcaption>Each row, or yarn, represents the full, contiguous sequence of operations for a given site.</figcaption>
</figure>

Storing the tree as an array means we have to be careful while modifying it, or our invariants will be invalidated and the whole thing will fall apart. When a local atom is created and parented to another atom, it is inserted immediately to the right of its parent in the weave. It's easy to show that this preserves the sort order: since the new atom necessarily has a higher Lamport timestamp than any other atom in the weave, it belongs in the spot closest to the parent. On merge, we have to be a bit more clever if we want to keep things *O*(*n*). The naive solutionâ€”iterating through the incoming weave and individually sorting each new atom into our local weaveâ€”would be *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>). If we had an easy way to compare any two atoms, we could perform a simple and efficient merge sort. Unfortunately, the order of two atoms is a non-binary function since it involves ancestry information in addition to the timestamp and UUID. In other words, you can't write a simple comparator for two atoms in isolation without also querying the full CT.

Fortunately, we can use our knowledge of the underlying tree structure to keep things simple. (The following algorithm assumes that both weaves are correctly ordered and preserve all their invariants.) Going forward, it's useful to think of each atom as the head of a subtree in the larger CT. On account of the DFS ordering used for the weave, all of an atom's descendants are contained in a contiguous range immediately to its right called a **causal block**. To merge, we compare both weaves atom-by-atom until we find a mismatch. There are three possibilities in this situation: the local CT has a subtree missing from the incoming CT, the incoming CT has a new subtree missing from the local CT, or the two CTs have concurrent sibling subtrees. (Proving that the only possible concurrent change to the same spot is that of sibling subtrees is an exercise left to the reader.) The first two cases are easy to check and deal with: verify that one of the two atoms appears in the other's CT and keep inserting or fast-forwarding atoms until the two weaves line up again. For the last case, we have to arrange the two causal blocks in their proper order. The end of a causal block is easy to determine using an algorithm featured in the paper[^lemma], and the only thing left to do after that is to compare the two head atoms and arrange the causal blocks accordingly. (Note that any stored yarns must also be updated as the weave changes!)

[^lemma]: Lemma 2: simply iterate through the atoms to the right of your head atom until you find one whose parent has a lower Lamport timestamp than the head. This atom is the first atom past the causal block. Although the paper uses awareness in this lemma, you can easily show that this property applies to Lamport timestamps as well.

One more data structure to note is a collection of site+timestamp pairs called a **weft**, which is simply a fancy name for a [version vector][versionvector]. You can think of this as a filter on the tree by way of a cut across yarns: one where only the atoms with a timestamp less than or equal to the one for their site in the weft are included. Wefts are very useful for functions such as past revision viewing and garbage collection, since they can uniquely address and split the document at any point in its mutation timeline.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/weft.svg" style="width:53rem">
<figcaption>The dotted line represents weft 1:6â€“2:7â€“3:7 in Lamport timestamp format, or weft 1:3â€“2:1â€“3:0 in index format. The two representations are equivalent.</figcaption>
</figure>

A weft needs to be **consistent** in two ways. First, there's consistency in the distributed computing sense: causality of operations must be maintained. This is easily enforced by ensuring that the tree is fully-connected under the cut. Second, the resulting tree must be able to produce an internally-consistent data structure with no invariants violated. This isn't an issue with strings, but there are other kinds of data where a tree might fall apart if cut in the wrong place. (More on that below.) In the given example, the weft describes the string "CDADE", providing a hypothetical view of the distributed data structure in the middle of all three edits.

# Demo: Concurrent Editing in macOS and iOS

Words, words, words! To prove that the Causal Tree is a useful and effective data structure in the real world, [I've implemented a generic version in Swift together with a demo app][crdt-playground]. Please note that this is strictly an educational codebase, not a production-quality library! My goal with this project was to dig for knowledge, not create another framework du jour. I apologize that there's no well-documented codebase or Javascript demonstration. It's messy, it's slow, and it's surely broken in some placesâ€”but it serves its purpose.

<p>From 0:00â€“0:23, sites 1â€“3 are created and connect to each other in a ring. From 0:23â€“0:34, sites 4 and 5 are forked from 1, establish a two-way connection to 1 to exchange peer info, then go back offline. At 0:38, site 4 connects to 5, which is still not sending data to anyone. At 0:42, site 5 connects to 1 and site 1 connects to 4, finally completing the network. At 0:48, all the sites go offline, then return online at 1:06.</p>
</div>

The first part of the demo is a macOS P2P simulator. Every window you see represents an independent site, each of which has a unique UUID and holds its own copy of the CT. The CTs are edited locally through the type-tailored editing view. New sites must be forked from existing sites, copying over the current state of the CT. Sites can go "online" and establish one-way connections to one or more known peers, which sends over their CT about once a second. On receipt, each site merges the inbound CT with their own. Not every site knows about every peer, and forked sites will be invisible to the rest of the network until they go online and connect to one of their known peers. All of this is done locally to simulate a partitioned, unreliable P2P network with a high degree of configurability: practically any kind of network topology or partition can be simulated. For string editing, the text view uses the CT directly as its backing store by way of an `NSMutableString` [wrapper][string-wrapper] plugged into a bare-bones `NSTextStorage` [subclass][container-wrapper].

Each site can display previously-synced, read-only revisions of its document via the dropdown list. This feature is just one of many emergent properties of CTs. On account of the immutable, atomic, and ordered nature of the format, you get this functionality effectively for free!

</div>

The second part of the demo is a very simple CloudKit-based text editing app for iOS. Much of it is wonky and unpolished (since I'm very much a CloudKit newbie), but the important part is that real-time collaboration (including remote cursors) works correctly and efficiently, whether syncing to the same user account, collaborating with others via CloudKit Sharing, or just working locally for long periods of time. The network layer has some hairy logic, but it only deals with binary data blobs and has no insight into the nature of the data structure. Conflicts are automatically resolved automatically on a higher level through the same branches of code. Best of all, no extra coordinating servers are required: the dumb CloudKit database works perfectly fine.

My CT implementation isn't quite production ready yet (though I'll keep hammering away for use in my own commercial projects), but I think it's convincing proof that the technique is sound and practical for use with collaborative document-based applications.

# Operational Replicated Data Types

Causal Trees, however, are just the beginning: there is a higher-level pattern at work here. Recent research projects, including Victor Grishchenko's [Replicated Object Notation][ron] (RON) and the paper [*Pure Operation-Based Replicated Data Types*][pure-op] (hereafter *PORDT*), have discovered an elegant way to analyze and build up CRDTs out of homogeneous operational units. Through their generality, these hybrid data structures stand at the vanguard of a fundamental, unifying theory of CRDTs. This is the foundational abstraction I had hoped to uncover when I first set out on my research mission.

For the sake of clarity, and since neither of the above projects seems terribly concerned with nomenclature, I'm going to be calling this new breed of CRDTs **operational replicated data types**â€”partly to avoid confusion with the exiting term "operation-based CRDTs" (or CmRDTs), and partly because "replicated data type" (RDT) seems to be gaining popularity over "CRDT", and the term can be expanded to "ORDT" without impinging on any existing terminology.

## What Is an ORDT?

Much like Causal Trees, ORDTs are directly built out of tiny, timestamped, and uniquely-identified "operations" arranged in a basic container structure. Each operation represents an atomic action on the data structure while simultaneously functioning as the unit of data resultant from that action. This crucial eventâ€“data duality means that the ORDT can be understood as either a conventional data structure with each unit of data augmented with event information, or alternatively as an event log of atomic actions ordered to resemble the output data type for ease of execution. (Refer back to the array explorations in the previous section.) Consequently, an ORDT doesn't necessarily need to be evaluated to produce the output data structure: many queries could be run on the data structure as-is[^ops]. Whether syncing single operations, applying longer patches, or performing full merges, any change to the data structure is integrated through the same sort of low-level "rebase", so the distinction between CmRDTs and CvRDTs becomes effectively moot.

[^ops]: And indeed, not all ORDT operations are necessarily meant to be executed! For example, the MVRegister ORDT is designed to present both possibilities of a concurrent change to the user. Operations are *simultaneously* events and data, and in some situations might be treated more like one than the other. *PORDT* describes it thusly: "indeed, there are useful concurrent data types in which the outcomes of concurrent executions are not equivalent (on purpose) to some linearization."

The decomposition of data structures into tagged units of atomic change feels like one of those rare foundational abstractions. Indeed, many existing CRDTs (such as RGA) have made passes at this concept without fully embracing it, incorporating authorship and logical timestamps into proto-operational structures that often get consumed during merge. With the ORDT approach, those same CRDTs can be expressed in a completely general way, unifying their interface and performance characteristics across the board while simultaneously enabling a wide array of useful features. RON has working implementations for LWW (last-writer-wins) registers, RGA, and basic sets, while *PORDT* additionally defines MVRegisters, AWSets, and RWSets.

<figure class="mostly-full-width">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/rdts.svg">
<figcaption>Some example ORDTs. Note that each ORDT has its own operation order: counter operations are arranged strictly by their Lamport timestamp (though the order really doesn't matter), LWW operations are sorted first by key and then by Lamport timestamp, and sequence operations are sorted as described in the CT section.</figcaption>
</figure>

What are some of the benefits granted by the operational approach? For one, merge and ordering become completely trivial: idempotency and commutativity naturally derive from the fact that each ORDT is only a collection of unique operations. Even causal order, which is critical for convergence in most CmRDTs, becomes a secondary concern: operations aren't "merged" so much as appended or inserted into the container data structure, so out-of-order events lacking their causal ancestors could simply be ignored on evaluation. (RON, for example, simply regards any causally-separated segments of an ORDT as "patches" that can be applied at a later time.) Actions that require dividing the data structure at a certain timestampâ€”garbage collection, past revision viewing, delta updatesâ€”become as simple as taking a version vector and splitting the operations into two sets. Since each operation is uniquely identified, it's possible to make deep permalinks from one the data structure into another: for example, by defining the cursor in a text editor as a reference to an atom representing the leftmost letter. ([This is what my iOS demo does][cursor].) On account of their uniformity, and since there's no history to replay, rehydrating the data structures from bits into objects becomes a basic *O*(*n*) or *O*(*n*log*n*) read, bringing us closer to the ideal of our zippy "golden file".

Defining data structures in terms of these low-level operations might seem like a needlessly bloated approach; for wouldn't it make more sense to keep the data structure pure and to move the convergence and history information over to a separate data structure? But I'd argue that the operational approach is the only one that stays true to nature of the problem. One way or another, every action in your convergent data type needs to be uniquely defined, identified, and timestamped. If that information isn't grouped together, your scheme will require complex coordination between the history parts and the data parts. Some new CRDTs (such as the one in [xi][xi]) do indeed try to keep the data structure and history separate; but the result is that the history structure has to be painfully tailored to the given data type, that the performance of certain algorithms (including past revision viewing and even merge) scales with the length of the history log, and that there's no standard way to send operations between sites. In other words, though this approach may seem pleasant at first glance, it has no generality and it's difficult to reason about. Separating out the concerns has made the system far more specialized. Meanwhile, ORDTs cut through all these issues without a second thought while maintaining *O*(*n*log*n*) performance in the worst case! I'd go as far as to say that defining CRDTs operationally is the *only* way to make them performant across the board, even though the marriage of state and history might initially seem a bit ugly.

## The ORDT Pipeline

Each ORDT operation is bestowed, at minimum, with an ID in the form of a site UUID and a Lamport timestamp, a location identifier (which is generally the ID of another operation), and a value. Operations are immutable and globally unique. An operation is meant to represent an atomic unit of change to the data structure, local in effect and directly dependent on one other operation at most. (In practice, operations can be designed to do pretty much anything with the data, but non-atomic or multi-causal operations will prevent the data structure from being directly interpretable and may severely affect performance, simplicity, and intent. Think: "[bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_(computing))".) Although each operation only contains a single Lamport timestamp, the location (or ancestry) pointer gives us almost as much additional information as a regular version vector. As a result, it becomes possible to group together concurrent operations without the untenable *O*(*n**s*) cost of a version vector per operation, as many distributed systems are required to do.

New operations (local and remote) are incorporated into the ORDT through a series of functions. (For clarity, I'm going to be referring to the container of operations as the **structured log** of the ORDT.)  The pipeline begins with an incoming stream of remote operations. For an ORDT in CvRDT mode, this would be a state snapshot in the form of another structured log; for CmRDT mode, any set of causally-linked operations, and often just a single one.

<figure class="mostly-full-width">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/pipeline.svg">
<figcaption>The operational pipeline. Both the reducer/effect and mapper/eval steps use pure functions tailored to the given ORDT. Location information has been stripped for each operation to simplify the diagram.</figcaption>
</figure>

New operations along with the existing structured log are first fed into a **reducer** (RON) or **effect** (*PORDT*) step. These take the form of pure functions that stick the operations into some sort of data structureâ€”a compressed sequence in RON and a simple set in *PORDT*â€”then simplify or remove any redundant operations as needed.

What is this "simplifying", you might ask? Aren't the operations meant to be immutable? Generally, yes; but in some ORDTs, new operations might definitively supersede previous operations. Take a LWW register, for example. In this very basic ORDT, the value of an operation with the highest timestamp+UUID supplants any previous operation's value. Since merge only needs to compare a new operation against the previous highest operation, it stands to reason there's simply no point in keeping the older operations around. (*PORDT* defines these stale operations in terms of **redundancy relations**, which are unique to each ORDT and are applied as part of the effect step.) Another possible reduction step is the stripping of ID or location data. In some ORDTs, this information becomes unnecessary for later convergence once operations are placed in their proper sorted order. In the RON implementation of RGA, the location (parent) data of an operation is stripped by the reducer once the operation is properly situated in the structured log. (The original RGA paper features a very similar cleanup step. RON and *PORDT* simply generalize this to other ORDTs.)

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/cleanup.svg" style="width:78rem">
<figcaption>Cleaning up redundant operations in a simple multi-LWW (dictionary) ORDT. Both produce the same result and incorporate new operations in the same way.</figcaption>
</figure>

Here, I have to diverge from my sources. In my opinion, the reducer/effect step ought to be split in two. Even though some ORDT operations might be redundant for convergence, retaining every operation in full allows us to know the exact state of our ORDT at any point in its history. Without this ability, relatively "free" features such as garbage collection and past revision viewing become much harder (if not impossible) to implement. Ergo, I posit that at this point in the pipeline, we ought to have a simpler **arranger** step. This function would perform the same kind of merge as the reducer/effect functions, but it wouldn't actually remove or modify any of the operations. Instead of happening implicitly, the previous simplification steps would be triggered in a more consistent and general way when space actually needs to be reclaimed. (More on that below.)

The final bit of the pipeline is the **mapper** (RON) or **eval** (*PORDT*) step. This is the code that finally makes sense of the structured log. It can either be a function that produces an output data structure by reading the operations in order, or alternatively a collection of functions that directly interface with the structured log itself. In the case of string ORDTs, the mapper might simply emit a native string object, or it might be an interface that lets you call methods such as `length`, `characterAtIndex:`, or even `replaceCharactersInRange:withString:` directly on the contents of the structured log.

The arranger/reducer/effect and the mapper/eval functions together form the two halves of the ORDT: one dealing with the low-level organization of data, the other with its user-facing interpretation. The data half, embodied in the organization of the structured log, needs to be structured in such a way that the interface half remains performant. If the structured log for an ORDT ends up kind of looking like the abstract data type it's meant to represent (e.g. a CT's weave â‡„ array), the design is probably on the right track. In effect, the operations should *become the data*.

So how is the structured log stored, anyway? *PORDT* does not appear to concern itself with the order of operations: every operation is stuck in a simple set. Unfortunately, this is highly inefficient for things like sequences. RON's insight is that the order of operations really matters for reducer performance, and so the operations are arranged in a so-called **frame** (which is a kind of compressed array). In both cases, operational storage is generic without any type-specific code. Everything custom about a particular data type is handled in the reducer/mapper and eval functions. 

But this is another point where I have to diverge from my sources. Rather than treating the log and all its associated functions as separate entities, I prefer to conceptualize the whole thing as a persistent, type-tailored object, distributing operations among various internal data structures and exposing merge and data access through an OO interface. In other words, the structured log, arranger, and parts of the mapper would combine to form one giant object.

<figure class="mostly-full-width">

<figcaption>An example object-based log for a string ORDT. The first cache is for "yarns", the second for ranges of visible characters. With these two caches, we can use the operations as a direct backing store for a native string object.</figcaption>
</figure>

ORDTs are meant to fill in for ordinary data structures, so sticking operations into some homogenous frame might lead to poor performance depending on the use case. For instance, many text editors now prefer to use the [rope data type][rope] instead of simple arrays. With a RON-style frame, this transition would be impossible. But with an object-based ORDT, we could almost trivially switch out our internal data structure for a rope and be on our merry way. (Only the merge function would require some extra care.) And this is just the beginning: more complex ORDTs might require numerous associated data types and caches to ensure optimal performance. The OO approach would ensure that all these secondary structures stayed together, remained consistent during merge, and offered a unified interface for data access. (More on the OO approach below.)

With all the pieces in place, it becomes trivial to reinterpret our Causal Tree in terms of this operational approach. The structured log is the weave array together with any yarn caches. The arranger is the merge function. The mapper is the `NSMutableString` wrapper around the CT. All the parts are already there with slightly different names.

## Garbage Collection

(This section is a bit speculative since I haven't implemented any of it, but I believe the logic is sound.)

Garbage collection has been a sticking point in CRDT research, and I believe that operational CRDTs offer an excellent foundation for exploring this problem. A garbage-collected ORDT can be thought of as a data structure in two parts: the "live" part and the compacted part. As we saw earlier, a CT can be split into two segments by way of a version vector (or weft in CT parlance). The same applies to any operational ORDT. In a garbage-collected ORDT, we can simply store a **baseline** weft alongside the main data structure to serve as the dividing line between the live and compact parts. Then, any site that receives the new baseline would be obliged to compact the operations falling under that weft, and to drop or orphan any operations that are not included in the weft but have a direct causal connection to any of the removed operations. The baseline can be thought of as just another operation in the ORDT: one that requires all prior operations to pass through the ORDT's particular garbage collection routine. The trick is making this operation commutative.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/baseline.svg" style="width:53rem">
<figcaption>The dotted line represents baseline 1:6â€“2:7â€“3:7. In practice, S1@T2 may not necessarily be removed in order to preserve S1@T3's ancestral ordering information.</figcaption>
</figure>

So what exactly does it mean to compact an ORDT? There are really two mechanisms in play here. First, there's "lossless" compaction, which is simply dropping operations that are no longer necessary for future convergence. (In *PORDT*, this property of operations is called *causal redundancy*, and the cleanup is performed in the effect function. Remember, we split this off from our arranger.) In essence, lossless compaction is strictly a local issue, since the only thing it affects is the ability for a client to rewind the ORDT and work with past revisions. As such, we don't even have to store it in a replicated variable: sites can just perform this cleanup step at their discretion. However, only simpler ORDTs (such as LWW registers) tend to have operations with this property.

The second kind of compaction involves dropping operations that are no longer reflected in the ORDT's output, but that others sites may still require to fully converge in the future. In a CT-style string ORDT, this would involve removing delete operations along with their target (parent) operations, then preserving the order of any sibling inserts concurrent with that delete[^rewrite]. The risk here is that if a deleted operation has children other than the delete on any sites, then those child operations will be orphaned if the baseline fails to include them. We can mitigate this by first stipulating that no new operations may be *knowingly* parented to operations with attached delete operations, and also that no delete operations may have any children or be deleted themselves. (In other words, sibling insert and delete operations would only ever occur in ORDTs with concurrent version vectors. This is the expected behavior anyway since the user can't insert to the right of deleted characters, but it should be codified programmatically.) With this precondition in place, we know that once a site has received a delete operation, it will never produce any new siblings for that operation. We therefore also know that once *every* site in the network has seen a particular delete operation and its causal ancestorsâ€”when that delete operation is *stable*â€”that no new operations concurrent to the delete will ever appear in the future, and that a baseline could in theory be constructed that avoids orphaning any operations across the network. (*PORDT* uses similar logic for its **stable** step, which comes after the effect step and cleans up any *causally stable* operations provably delivered to all other sites.)

[^rewrite]: There are a few possible ways to implement this. For example, the garbage-collected operations could be stored as an ordered block of data in their own separate area of the structured log. Keeping the operations in order would additionally allow them to drop their location identifiers and save even more space. (This is the strategy that *PORDT* recommends.) However, there may be performance repercussions (and headaches) from having the data split into two parts like that, especially if you're relying on spatial locality and random access for your mapper/eval step. An alternative is to keep the compacted operations mixed in with the live operations, but to only remove operations with no children other than delete operation. This might sound wastefulâ€”almost every character will have an adjacent character, right?â€”but the property does cascade. Once the final operation at the end of a consecutive range of deletes is removed, the others can be picked off one by one in turn. And as an additional optimization, if a deleted operation's only child (other than the delete) is another deleted operation, then the child can take the place of its parent. This bit of rewriting of history is harmless since no new operations can be knowingly added to deleted operations, but may involve some extra code complexity and checks. Compaction schemes will vary for other ORDTs. Keep in mind that in order for an ORDT before and after garbage collection to produce identical output, every operation possibly affected by the removal of an operation has to be dealt with. With sequence ORDTs, these would only be the parent and concurrent children of a delete; with other ORDTs, possibly more than that.

Here's where we hit a snag. Generally speaking, CRDT research focuses on operation-based CmRDTs, with the latent assumption that those CRDTs are going be used as part of some distributed system. In other words: the CRDTs are meant to support real-time collaboration and smooth over any sync issues, but client-server (or client-cloud, or even client-client) communication is still expected. In my own exploration of this topic, I have made no such assumptions. The CRDTs as described above are system-agnostic mathematical structures, and it makes no difference to the algorithms how the data gets from one place to another. Even communication isn't a strict requirement! Someone could leave a copy of their CvRDT on an office thumb drive, return a year later, and successfully merge all the new changes back into their copy. This means that every time some additional bit of synchronization is mandated or assumed, the possibility space of the design shrinks and generality is lost. The messiness of time and state are injected into an otherwise functional system.

Unfortunately, garbage collection might be the one subsystem where a bit of coordination is actually required.

Take baseline selection, for instance. In an [available and partition-tolerant system][cap] system, is it possible to devise a selection scheme that always garbage collects without orphaning any operations? Logically speaking, no: if some site copies the ORDT from storage and then works on it in isolation, there's no way the other sites will be able to take it into account when picking their baseline. However, if we require our system to only permit forks via request to an existing site, and also that any forked sites ACK back to their origin site on successful initialization, then we would have enough constraints to make selection work. Each site could hold a map of every site's ID to its last known version vector. When a fork happens, the origin site would add the new site ID to its map and seed it with its own timestamp. This map would be sent along with every operation or state snapshot between sites and merged at the receiver. (In essence, it would act as a distributed overview of the network.) Now, any site with enough information about the others would be free to independently set a baseline that a) is causally consistent, b) is consistent by the rules of the ORDT, c) includes only those removable operations that have been received by every site in the network, and d) also includes every operation affected by the removal of those operations. With these preconditions, you can prove that even concurrent updates of the baseline across different sites will converge.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/garbage-collection.gif">
<figcaption>An example of network knowledge propagation. Site 2 is forked from 1, Site 3 from 2, and Site 4 from 3â€”all with state AB. At the start, Site 1's C has been received by Site 2, but not Site 3. Maps are updated on receipt, not on send. In the end, Site 1 knows that every site has at least moved past ABE (or weft 1:2â€“2:Xâ€“3:Xâ€“4:9), making it a candidate for the new baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>

But questions still remain. For instance: what do we do if a site simply stops editing and never returns to the network? It would at that point be impossible to set the baseline anywhere in the network past the last seen version vector from that site. Now some sort of timeout scheme has to be introduced, and I'm not sure this is possible in a truly partitioned system. There's just no way to tell if a site has left forever or if it's simply editing away in its own parallel partition. So we have to add some sort of mandated communication between sites, or perhaps some central authority to validate connectivity, and now the system is constrained even more! In addition, as an *O*(*s*<sup>2</sup>) space complexity data structure, the site-to-timestamp map could get unwieldily depending on the number of peers.

Alternatively, we might relax rule c) and allow the baseline to potentially orphan remote operations. In this scheme, we would have a sequence of baselines associated with our ORDT. Any site would be free to pick a new baseline that was explicitly higher than (not concurrent to!) the previous baseline, taking care to pick one that had the highest chance of preserving operations on other sites[^preservation]. Then, any site receiving new baselines in the sequence would be required to apply them in order[^baselines]. Upon receiving and executing a baseline, a site that had operations causally dependent on the newly-removed operations but not included in the baseline would be obliged to either drop them or to add them to some sort of secondary "orphanage" ORDT.

[^preservation]: If we still had access to our site-to-version-vector map, we could pick a baseline common to every reasonably active site. This heuristic could be further improved by upgrading our Lamport timestamp to a [hybrid logical clock][hlc]. (A Lamport timestamp is allowed to be arbitrarily higher than the previous timestamp, not just +1 higher, so we can combine it with a physical timestamp and correction data to get the approximate wall clock time for each operation.)

[^baselines]: We have to use a sequence of baselines and not just a baseline register because all sites, per CRDT rules, must end up with the same data after seeing the same set of operations. With a register, if a site happens to miss a few baselines, it could end up retaining some meant-to-be-orphaned operations if a new baseline gets far enough to include them. Now some sites would have the orphans and others wouldn't. Inconsistency!

But even here we run into problems with coordination. If this scheme worked as written, we would be a-OK, so long as sites were triggering garbage collection relatively infrequently and only during quiescent moments (as determined to the best of a site's ability). But we have a bit of an issue when it comes to picking strictly higher baselines. What happens if two peers concurrently pick new baselines that orphan each others' operations?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/garbage.svg" style="width:19rem">

Assume that at this point in time, Site 2 and Site 3 don't know about each other and haven't received each other's operations yet. The system starts with a blank garbage collection baseline. Site 2 decides to garbage collect with baseline 1:3â€“2:6, leaving behind operations "ACD". Site 3 garbage collects with baseline 1:3â€“3:7, leaving operations "ABE". Meanwhile, Site 1â€”which has received both Site 2 and 3's changesâ€”decides to garbage collect with baseline 1:3â€“2:6â€“3:7, leaving operations "AED". So what do we do when Sites 2 and 3 exchange messages? How do we merge "ACD" and "ABE" to result in the correct answer of "AED"? In fact, too much information has been lost: 2 doesn't know to delete C and 3 doesn't know to delete B. We're kind of stuck.

(I have to stress that baseline operations *must* behave like ordinary ORDT operations in the sense that they converge to the same result regardless of their order of arrival. If they don't, our CRDT invariants break and eventual consistency falls out of our reach.)

In this toy example, it may still be possible to converge by drawing inferences about the missing operations from the baseline version vector of each site. But that trick won't work with more devious examples featuring multiple sites deleting each others' operations and deletions spanning multiple adjacent operations. *Maybe* there exists some clever scheme which can bring us back to the correct state with any combination of partial compactions, but my hunch is that this situation is provably impossible to resolve in a local way without accruing ancestry metadataâ€”at which point you're left with the same space complexity as the non-compacted case anyway.

Thereforeâ€”just as with the non-destructive baseline strategyâ€”it seems that the only way to make this work is to add a bit of coordination. This might take the form of:

- Designating one or more sites superusers and making them decide on the baselines for all other sites.
- Putting the baseline to vote among a majority/plurality of connected sites.
- Relying on a server to synchronously store the current baseline. (This might be the best strategy for a system built on top of something like CloudKit. The syncing mechanism is centralized and synchronous anyway, so might as well force sites to pull the baseline on sync.)
- Enforcing a real-time clock scheme. As long as clients are synced to an accurate master clock, perhaps operations could become compactable once some preset amount of time has passed. (There has to be some sort of mitigation for sites that can't keep time accurately enough.)
- Allowing sites that end up losing in a concurrent baseline adjustment to pull the full ORDT from somewhere, or to get the necessary parts from their peers.

In summary: while baseline operations are not commutative for every possible value, they can be made commutative with just a sprinkle of coordination. Either you ensure that a baseline *does not leave orphaned operations* (which requires some degree of knowledge about every site on the network), or you ensure that *each new baseline is higher than the last* (which requires a common point of synchronization). Fortunately, the messy business of coordination is localized to the problem of picking the data for a single operation, not to the functioning of the operation itself or any other part of the ORDT. There's nothing special or unique about the baseline operation with respect to the rules of CRDTs, and so it can be treated, transferred, and processed just like any other operation. And if the baseline fails to get updated due to network conditions, nothing bad actually happens, and sites are still free to work on their documents. The scheme degrades very gracefully.

For one last idea, if the ORDT propagation mechanism is restricted to state snapshots (as in a CvRDT), you could allow any site to arbitrarily set the baseline, but then replace any removed operations during a merge if the incoming state snapshot happens to include causal dependents of those removed operations. (This is possible because every state snapshot is a consistent version of the ORDT, so the missing operations can be revived without having to make any additional requests.) Personally, I'm not too comfortable with this approach. My feeling is that it breaks CRDT monotonicity by allowing state to be restored, though it's not clear to me where this inconsistency might rear its head. It's much more correct for baselines to follow the rules of every other operation and move the CRDT forward through the monotonic semilattice. But I concede that this could possibly be the one perfect, coordination-free garbage collection approachâ€”just as long as strictly CvRDT use was OK.

Finally, remember that in many cases, "don't worry about garbage collection" is also a viable option! Most collaborative documents aren't meant to be edited in perpetuity, and assuming good faith on the part of all collaborators, it would be surprising if the amount of deleted content (and thus, garbage) in a typical document was more than 2 or 3 times its visible length.

## ORDT Design & Implementation

I've been thinking about the best way to integrate operation-based CRDTs into production software. [RON][ron], though incomplete, offers a blueprint for a general, flexible, and highly functional system. However, I think there's a lot to be said for object-based ORDTsâ€”especially where low-latency software is concerned.

To reiterate, RON stores the operations for any ORDT in a homogeneous, immutable *frame* data structure and pushes everything unique about the ORDT into the reducer and mapper functions. The system is data-oriented and self-configuring. Each set of operations contains location and data type information which allows the pipeline to route operations to the correct ORDT frame without any boilerplate. The reducers are actually multi-mode functions that can merge individual operations, partial frames (patches), or full frames (state snapshots) in *O*(*n*log*n*) time by way of heap sort, allowing RON to function equally well in CmRDT or CvRDT mode (or perhaps even mix modes on the fly). Operations are described using a regular language that compresses very well when stored in a frame, and an even more efficient binary mode is available. The end result is a teeming river of operations that can automatically form into larger, interconnected structures.

In the object-based approach, operations, reducer/mapper functions, and any relevant caches are herded into persistent, mutable objects. Certainly, there are many hassles with this compared to the RON paradigm: everything is tightly-coupled, ownership becomes a critical factor, a lot more boilerplate is involved. Since there's no built-in data layer, object management becomes a major concern. In exchange, you can target performance chokepoints with precision. A generic RON frame with *O*(*n*) reads and O(*n*log*n*) writes might be good for the general case, but there are plenty of problems where *O*(1) or *O*(log*n*) for certain functions is a hard requirement. Objects have the freedom to distribute their operations among various data structures, maintain caches of operations, and otherwise structure themselves for efficient queries. Since operations are stored as individual structs, they take up more space than in RON, but also benefit tremendously from memory locality and random access. The conception of ORDTs as independent structures allows them to be used in non-network contexts; for example, as a way of dealing with local file merge or synchronizing data across threads. ([Atom Xray and xi](https://google.github.io/xi-editor/docs/crdt.html) already use CRDTs in this manner, and it seems that lock-free data structures could similarly benefit from this approach.) And unlike RON, there's no mapping step from frame to user data: the object can be used as a native data type, never goes stale, and never has to convert itself into different formats. (Think of the `NSMutableString` wrapper around the CT: you can use it just like any old system string.) All these factors really give this approach the leg up in low-level code.

Consider a hypothetical replicated bitmap as a thought experiment. Perhaps in the same vein as Reddit's [/r/place](http://i.imgur.com/ajWiAYi.png), you're working on a giant image with a bunch of different peopleâ€”some online, some offlineâ€”and you want the whole thing to sensibly merge when the different parts come together. As a starting point, say the bitmap is conceived as a grid of LWW registers[^lww], and that each operation contains a single pixel's coordinates and RGBA color as the value. Let's also say that the image is 5000Ã—5000 pixels and that each set-pixel operation couldn't be made smaller than 16 bytes. This means that once the entire canvas fills up, you'll be using about 400MB of uncompressed memoryâ€”and that doesn't even include any past history. Given that throughput for a single site could be in the hundreds of pixels per second, it's crucial that each set-pixel operation execute locally in *O*(log*n*) time at most. It's also vital for the garbage collector to be able to trim the ORDT very often and very quickly, since even a few layers of history would eat up all your RAM. (Technically, garbage collection isn't even needed in a LWW contextâ€”see *causal redundancy* aboveâ€”but maybe it's desirable for the app to have the full bitmap history until the memory situation is truly dire.) Perhaps it should even be possible to tile the bitmap and pull different chunks from storage as you're working on them.

[^lww]: In reality, to make the merge more meaningful and avoid artifacts, it would be better to keep around a sequence ORDT of session IDs alongside the bitmap. Each site would generate new session IDs at sensible intervals and add them to the end of the sequence, and each new pixel would reference the last available session ID. Pixels would be sorted first by session, then by timestamp+UUID. (Basically, these would function as ad hoc layers.) But LWW is easier to talk about, so let's just go with that.

My feeling is that RON's general approach would falter here. The pipeline simply couldn't be tuned to fix these performance hot spots, and millions of pixel operations would grind it to a halt. With the object-based approach, you could store store the bitmap as a specialized k-d tree of buffers. The pixel values would be the operations themselves, and each buffer would represent a particular area of pixels , subdivided when needed to store a pixel's past operations. Since the buffers would be stored in contiguous chunks of memory, subdivision and rebalancing would be very fast. Garbage collection could be as simple as un-subdividing any buffer with too many subdivisions. Assuming that the RGBA value for each operation was formatted correctly and that a stride could be passed along to the graphics framework, nodes could be blitted as-is into another buffer, making it trivial to only update the dirty parts of a user's rendered image. In short, it seems that performance could end up being very close to that of an *actual* bitmap. It wouldn't even surprise me if /r/place itselfâ€”with its 16 million changes and 1 million unique sitesâ€”could be reproduced with this kind of object!

</figure>

Finally, a few nascent thoughts on designing new ORDTs. The inherently-ordered and immutable nature of operations means that the ORDT approach is basically a "replicated data type construction kit". Since ORDTs are merely collections of unique operations, commutativity and idempotency are built in by definition. The hard design work is in figuring out how to atomize the data structure, define causal relationships, order the operations, and optimize performance for critical methods. In other words: perfect engineering work, not something that requires a math degree!

I've only really gone through this process for the nascent bitmap ORDT shown above, but these are some thoughts that crossed my mind while I was doing it:

* The operations *are* the data. Design your operations and organize your data structures so that you can query the ORDT directly instead of having to actually execute the operations first. Start with the data type you're trying to ORDT-ify and figure out the best way to divide it into atomic pieces of data while keeping the original structure intact. Not every data type will be susceptible to atomization, but many will be.
* As much as possible, avoid operations that have non-local effects, multiple causes, or affect multiple future operations. (Good operation: "Insert Letter After Letter". Bad operation: "Capitalize All Existing Letters".) There has to be a degree of symmetry between the operations and their effect on the data structure: local cause, local consequences.
* Keep in mind the essential functions: initialization, operation insertion, merging, garbage collection, serialization and deserialization. Nothing should be slower than *O*(*n*log*n*).
* If garbage collection is going to be used, restrict the effective range of your removable operations. Ensure that only operations prior and concurrent to the removable operation could possibly be affected by its removalâ€”none afterwards.
* If using the object-based approach, ensure that each operation only exists in a single data structure at a time. Don't rely on "incidental state" such as insertion order; keep your data structures organized, sorted, and balanced at all times. Avoid moving operations between data structures. Instead of thinking of your object as having state, treat it as an organizational structure for your immutable operations: a kind of advanced frame.
* One exception: caches of operations might be needed for optimal performance in some scenarios. (Example: yarns in the CT for *O*(1) atom lookups by ID.) If you have caches, make absolutely, 100% sure that they're consistent following all mutating operations; that they're never serialized; and that it's possible to efficiently recreate them on initialization. Caches are one of the easiest ways to corrupt your data!

With that said, the need to design a new ORDT should be relatively rare. Most data will be representable through the composition of existing ORDTs, e.g. sequences and maps. Nonetheless, my feeling is that certain kinds of interactive softwareâ€”drawing, music, and games, for exampleâ€”would be impossible to CRDT-ify without using this approach. And in any case, it's a fun topic to think about!

# Causal Trees In Depth

But now, let's get back to our favorite data structure! I'd like to posit that the humble Causal Tree, though nominally intended for sequence use, is actually one of the most versatile expressions of the operational CRDT formula.

First, the structure of a CT has strong parallels to the git model[^git], making it very intuitive to work with and reason about. Rather than pointing to a historic revision of a file, each "commit" (or operation) stands for an atomic change in data, while the weave is simply a rebase of the entire timeline. Related operations naturally chain together, and conflicts are reified as sibling branches that can easily be resolved in the eval/mapper stepâ€”or even presented to the user for consideration. Causality and authorship information can be used to divide up the timeline in order to produce, for example, a version of the data structure at a specific point in time, or without a particular author's set of changes. The same mental tools used to reason about git can naturally transfer over to CTs, with the simplification that none of the commits actually interfere with each other.

[^git]: And in fact, CT-based documents would be quite synergetic with regular git! Instead of pointing to a file blob, each commit would only need to retain a version vector along with the commit message. The CT would incorporate all the relevant history information and could always be restored to its previous state, assuming no garbage collection had taken place.

Next, we know [from other domains](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html) that trees can be used to simulate practically any existing data type, from arrays to dictionaries to registers. Subtrees can be used to separate out different parts of the document, so you could have a sequence subtree, another dictionary subtree, and any other individual data structures contained in the same chunk of data. In other words, CTs are inherently structured and composable.

Finally, since CTs are (generally) stored in contiguous memory, most operations are *O*(*n*) or *O*(*n*log*n*) and massively benefit from spatial localityâ€”to the point where complex copy-on-write or locking schemes can be eschewed in favor of straight, dumb copies when working with multiple threads. It's hard to beat a plain ol' range-of-memory when it comes to optimizing performance, especially when serialization and deserialization are so frequent.

Together, all these properties make CTs perfect for use as a sort of quick-and-dirty "convergent struct". But we need to flesh out a few details first...

## Implementation Details

Before even touching the CT, it makes sense to define a general CvRDT protocol. Among other things, this allows CvRDTs to easily compose by forwarding all the relevant calls to their child CvRDTs.

```swift
public protocol CvRDT: Codable, Hashable
{
    // must obey CvRDT convergence properties
    mutating func integrate(_ v: inout Self)
    
    // for avoiding needless merging; should be efficient
    func superset(_ v: inout Self) -> Bool
    
    // ensures that our invariants are correct, for debugging and sanity checking
    func validate() throws -> Bool
}
```

CvRDTs are especially vulnerable to bad input since there's no guarantee of a central server to fix mistakes. In order to minimally safeguard against malicious and misbehaving peers, Iâ€™ve added a validation method to this interface. In the CT case, the `validate` method goes through the weave and checks as many preconditions as possible, including child ordering, atom type, priority atom behavior, and several others.

Next, if a CvRDT is an operational ORDT as described in the previous section, we can expose even more functionality through the interface:

```swift
public protocol OperationalCvRDT: CvRDT
{
    var lamportClock: CRDTCounter<Int32> { get }
  
    func baseline() -> Weft // the point beyond which the CvRDT is compacted or reduced
    mutating func garbageCollect(_ w: Weft) // sets the baseline
 
    // make the CvRDT behave like an older (read-only) revision
    func revision() -> Weft?
    mutating func setRevision(_ r: Weft?) throws
  
    mutating func blame(_ a: AtomId) -> SiteIndex?
}
```

The methods for viewing past revisions aren't necessary, but they're potentially very useful to the end user and almost trivial to implement in operational CRDTs. If you know that a particular weft is consistent, getting a read-only view of the object at that point in time is as simple as filtering out operations older than the given weft and maybe regenerating the caches. (My string CT does this through the use of array slices.) As for getting a list of consistent wefts, one simple way to do this is to store the current weft right before any remote changes are integrated.

Next: UUIDs. So far, I've been describing my site identifiers as 16-bit integers since it's unlikely that any document would have more than 65,000 collaborators. (And frankly, in most cases 8 or even 4 bits would do.) However, this is not enough for any reasonable definition of a UUID. Without coordination, you'll need a minimum of 128 bits to generate a truly unique value, but storing the full 128-bit UUID in each atomâ€”once for its own site and once for its causeâ€”would balloon it to 3x the original size!

I've solved this with the help of a secondary CRDT that is stored and transferred along with the CT: an ordered, insert-only array of known UUIDs called the **site map**. The 16-bit site identifier corresponding to a UUID is simply its index in this array.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/site-map.svg" style="width:68.5rem">
</figure>

When two CTs merge, their site maps merge as well. This means that our site identifiers are only unique locally, not globally: if a new UUID gets added at another site and then merged into ours, the sorted order of the existing UUIDs in the site map might change. When this happens, I traverse each CT and remap any outdated site identifiers to their new valuesâ€”a simple *O*(*n*) operation. This is facilitated by the following interface:

```swift
public protocol IndexRemappable
{
    mutating func remapIndices(_ map: [SiteId:SiteId])
}
```

Any CRDT that makes use of the site map needs to implement this protocol. Whenever a merge is invoked that would cause some of the site IDs to change, the `remapIndices` method gets called on the CRDT before the merge is actually executed. We're running *O*(*n*) operations when receiving remote data anyway, so performance is not a huge factor. Nonetheless, I made one additional tweak to ensure that remapping only happens very rarely. Instead of storing just the UUID in the site map, I also store the wall clock time at which the UUID was added. These tuples are sorted first by time, then by UUID. Assuming that modern connected devices tend to have relatively accurate clocks (but not relying on this fact for correctness), we can ensure that new sites almost always get appended to the end of the ordered list and thus avoid shifting any of the existing UUIDs out of their previous spots. The only exception is when multiple sites happen to be added concurrently or when the wall clock on a site is significantly off.

In summary, the final interface to our CT ends up looking something like this:

```swift
public protocol CausalTreeSiteUUIDT: Hashable, Comparable, Codable {}
public protocol CausalTreeValueT: IndexRemappable, Codable {}

public final class SiteIndex
    <S: CausalTreeSiteUUIDT> :
    CvRDT, NSCopying
{
    // etc.
}

public final class Weave
    <S: CausalTreeSiteUUIDT, V: CausalTreeValueT> :
    OperationalCvRDT, IndexRemappable, NSCopying
{
    public private(set) var lamportTimestamp: CRDTCounter<Int32>
  
    // etc.
}

public final class CausalTree
    <S: CausalTreeSiteUUIDT, V: CausalTreeValueT> :
    OperationalCvRDT, IndexRemappable, NSCopying
{
    public private(set) var siteIndex: SiteIndex<S>
    public private(set) var weave: Weave<S, V>
    
    // etc., with CvRDT interface calls forwarded to the site index and weave
}
```

One last feature specific to CTs is the priority flag for atoms. If an atom has priority, it gets sorted ahead of all its siblings in the parent's causal block, even if it has a lower Lamport timestamp. (Put another way, a priority flag is simply another variable to be used in the sorting comparator, i.e. timestamp+UUID+priority.) This property gives us a lot of structural control, ensuring that, for instance, delete atoms hug their corresponding insert atoms and never find themselves lost in the weave after a merge of concurrent insert operations. It does require some special casing during weave mutation and merge, however.

With the priority flag in tow, the value enum for our CT string atoms now looks something like this:

```swift
protocol CausalTreePrioritizable { var priority: Bool { get } }

enum StringValue: IndexRemappable, Codable, CausalTreePrioritizable
{
    case null
    case insert(char: UInt16)
    case delete
  
    func priority() -> Bool
    {
        if case .delete = self
        {
            return true
        }
        else
        {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    mutating func remapIndices(_ map: [SiteId:SiteId]) {}
  
    // insert Codable boilerplate here
}

typealias StringAtom = Atom<StringValue>
```

And that's all we really need to start implementing custom data types!

## Representing Non-String Objects

In order to implement a custom data type as a CT, you first have to "atomize" it, or decompose it into a set of basic operations, then figure out how to link up those operations such that a mostly linear traversal of the CT will produce your output data. (In other words, make the structure analogous to a one- or two-pass parsable format.)

In the demo section, I presented a CT designed for BÃ©zier drawing. Here's how I coded the value enum for each atom:

```swift
enum DrawDatum: IndexRemappable, Codable, CausalTreePrioritizable
{    
    case null // no-op for grouping other atoms
    case shape
    case point(pos: NSPoint)
    case pointSentinelStart
    case pointSentinelEnd
    case trTranslate(delta: NSPoint, ref: AtomId)
    case attrColor(ColorTuple)
    case attrRound(Bool)
    case delete
  
    var priority: Bool
    {
        switch self
        {
        case .null:
            return true
        case .shape:
            return false
        case .point:
            return false
        case .pointSentinelStart:
            return false
        case .pointSentinelEnd:
            return false
        case .trTranslate:
            return true
        case .attrColor:
            return true
        case .attrRound:
            return true
        case .delete:
            return true
        }
    }
    
    mutating func remapIndices(_ map: [SiteId:SiteId])
    {
        switch self
        {
        case .trTranslate(let delta, let ref):
            if let newSite = map[ref.site]
            {
                self = .trTranslate(delta: delta, ref: AtomId(site: newSite, index: ref.index))
            }
        default:
            break
        }
    }
  
    // insert Codable boilerplate here
}

typealias DrawAtom = Atom<DrawDatum>
```

Swift is kind enough to compress this down to about 23 bytes: the maximum size of an associated value tuple (opTranslate, which has a 16-byte `NSPoint` and a 6 byte `AtomId`) plus a byte for the case. Note that `IndexRemappable` actually needs to do something in this case since we might be carrying around an `AtomId` reference.

Note that `trTranslate` has an atom ID as an associated value. Since atom IDs are unique, you can reference them from other atoms without issue[^causalpast]. It's a great way to represent ranged operations: just pick an atom that represents the outer position of your range, add the ID to the operation's value, and handle it in your mapping/evaluation code. (This should especially come in handy when dealing with text formatting in rich text editors.) The only caveat is that the atom has to update this value in the `IndexRemappable` implementation. (Incidentally, I still need to port this functionality to my string CT's delete operation: ranged deletes are so much more performant than deleting each character individually!)

[^causalpast]: Well, as long as the referenced atom is in the new atom's causal past. What this means is that you shouldn't reference atoms that aren't already part of your CT, whichâ€”why would anyone do that? Are you smuggling atom IDs through a side channel or something? I suppose it might be a case worth adding to the `validate` method to help detect Byzantine faults.

Anyway, back to shapes. For the following sample document...

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/draw-shapes.svg" style="width:40rem">
</figure>

...we might end up with a tree shaped like this. (For completeness, I've added a few extra transformation and attribute operations that aren't directly visible in the user-facing data.)

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/draw-tree.svg">
<figcaption>The pink operations have the priority flag and sort ahead of their sibling subtrees.</figcaption>
</figure>

Just a few simple rules define the higher-level structures that represent shapes, points, and properties in this tree. A `shape` atom can only be parented to other `shape` atoms or to the root starting atom. Each `shape` has a null atom as its only child, acting as the root node for all property subtrees relevant to that shape. This atom can contain three child subtrees at most: a chain of transformations, a chain of attributes, and a chain of points. Transformation and attribute chains hug their parent in the weave via the priority flag while points go last. Any new transformations and attributes are parented to the last member of their corresponding chain. The value for a chain of operations (currently only `trTranslate`) is cumulative, while the value for a chain of attributes (`attrColor` or `attrRound`) is just the last atom in the chain. Point chains act more like traditional sequences. A point chain is seeded with a start and end sentinel to cleanly delineate it from its neighbors, and the traversal order corresponds to the order of the points in the eventual output `NSBezierPath`. Like shapes, points can have child transformation and attribute chains. Points can also have child delete atoms. (Shapes aren't currently deletable: you can individually remove all the points anyway and I got lazy.)

In essence, this CT consists of a bunch of superimposed operational CRDTs: sequences for shapes and points, LWW registers for attributes, and a reducing CRDT for transformations. 

Here is the weave we get from reading the tree in DFS order:

<figure class="mostly-full-width">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/causal-trees/draw-weave.svg">
<figcaption>The green brackets are shape blocks, blue brackets are point blocks, and red brackets are attribute blocks.</figcaption>
</figure>

The rules for generating the output image from this weave are very simple. If you hit a shape atom, you're in a shape block until you run into another shape atom or the end of the weave. The shape's operation and attribute chains are traversed first on account of their priority flag, and the results are cached for use in the next step. An `NSBezierPath` is created once you start reading points. Each point block has to read forward a bit to parse its operation and attribute chains (if any). If a delete atom is found, you can simply move on to the next point. Otherwise, the point's position is determined by combining its origin and transform (if any) with the parent shape's transform (if any). The point is added to the `NSBezierPath` either as as a line or as a BÃ©zier curve if it has the rounded attribute. Then, once the next shape block or the end of weave is reached, the path is drawn and stroked.

When I first started reading up on CRDTs, it was unclear to me how conflict resolution was formalized. Every CRDT seemed to do something a bit differentâ€”often laden with dense theoryâ€”and it was rare to find an approach that the developer could tweak depending on their needs. In CTs, the answer is refreshingly simple: conflicts occur when an atom has more children than expected, and the presentation of this fact is delegated to a higher layer. (My understanding is that the MV-Register CRDT behaves in a similar way.) Translation operations in the BÃ©zier CT are a good example. Let's say three different sites concurrently move the same point in the same direction. By default, the CT would produce a weave with three consecutive translations. Applying them in order would be consistent, but it would also triple the magnitude of the translation and match none of the sites' intended actions. Instead, we can detect when a translation atom has multiple children and then simply average out those values. This would cause the final translation to reasonably approximate each of the original values and hopefully leave all three sites satisfied. If some user still finds this merge offensive, they can manually adjust the translation and implicitly "commit" the change with their new operation.

This is only one possible approach, however, and the developer is free to do anything when a conflict is detected: present a selection to the user, pick the value with the lowest timestamp, use some special function for combining the values. The underlying CT will *always* remain consistent under concurrency; figuring out what to do with this information is entirely up to the app.

Finally, my implementation includes a [new, stateless layer](https://github.com/archagon/crdt-playground/blob/269784032d01dc12bd46d43caa5b7047465de5ae/CRDTPlayground/TestingExtras/Data%20Interfaces/CausalTreeBezierWrapper.swift) on top of the CT that provides a more model-appropriate API and sanity checking. Since the BÃ©zier tree has more constraints on its structure than the underlying CT, there's an additional, higher-level `validate` method that verifies all the new preconditions after the CT is itself validated. Other helper functions ensure that the consistency of the tree is not compromised when new points, shapes, or attributes are added. From the outside, callers can safely use methods like `addShape` or `updateAttributes` on the wrapper without having to worry about the CT at all. It looks just like any other model object. (Incidentally, this approach to layering CRDTs is discussed in [this paper][layering], though the technique isn't exactly novel.)

It's possible that the use case of representing custom data types as CTs is a bit esoteric. Certainly, I wouldn't use a CT for something like a PSD or DOC file. But just as with structs versus objects, I can imagine a number of scenarios where a small, custom CT might make the code so much cleaner and more performant than a higher-level collection of array, map, and register CRDTs. Quick, versatile, and simple data structures often turn out to be very practical tools!

## Performance

OT and CRDT papers often cite 50ms[^latency] as the point at which people start to notice latency in their text editors. Therefore, any code we might want to run on a CTâ€”including merge, initialization, and serializationâ€”has to fall within this range. Except for trivial cases, this precludes *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) or slower complexity: a 10,000 word article at 0.01ms per character would take 8 hours to process! The essential CT functions therefore have to be *O*(*n*log*n*) at the very worst.

[^latency]: This is a number pulled from several CRDT papers, but in principle, I'm more inclined to agree with Atom Xray's [8ms target](https://github.com/atom/xray#high-performance). Regardless, the conclusions don't change very much: *O*(*n*log*n*) remains sufficient even with very large files, and there are alternatives for the edge cases.

The simplest implementation of a weave is a contiguous array of atoms. Since every mutation resolves to an atom insertion, *O*(*n*) is the baseline for any mutation (except for appends to the end). On account of spatial locality, this should be fine for the majority of use cases: [Mike Ash's benchmarks][benchmarks] show that an iPhone 6s can `memcpy` 1MB in 0.12ms, meaning that performance will probably be fine as long as the CT stays under â‰ˆ400MB. It also helps that the CT involves only a limited number of heap allocations and no pointer-chasing at all. If that's not good enough, it should be possible to switch out the array for something like [xi's copy-on-write rope][xi-rope] for specialized use cases.

My CT implementation maintains a cache of site yarns alongside the weave which incurs a slight performance penalty. Yarns are also stored as one contiguous array, meaning that there's an additional *O*(*n*) cost for every weave mutation. Additionally, whenever a CT is received from another site, its yarns have to be regenerated on initialization. (Yarns are not part of the serialized data for reasons mentioned at the end of the ORDT section.) Yarn generation is *O*(*n*log*n*) since it's isomorphic to sorting the weave. In exchange, the yarns give us *O*(1) for the very common operation of looking up atoms by their identifier. Finding an atom's weave index is still *O*(*n*), but this is a minor issue since the index is only really used when inserting new operations, and that's an *O*(*n*) process already.

Merging with another CT is almost always *O*(*n*log*n*). This involves iterating the two weaves together, comparing atoms by parentage and timestamp, constructing a new interwoven weave, and then regenerating the yarn cache. On occasion, a priority atom conflict might require finding the least common ancestor between two atoms in *O*(*n*), but this should be exceedingly rare. (And in any case, it's unlikely that the two operations will differ by more than a couple of ancestors.)

Weave validation is only *O*(*n*). All we have to do is look at each atom and keep track of a few counters to ensure that sibling order is correct and that causality is not violated. This is usually invoked on deserialization.

As state-based CRDTs, CTs have a large memory footprint, both on account of the operation size and accumulated garbage. Assuming that a document is unlikely to contain more than 30% garbage, a 20,000 word article (like this one!) would eat up about 2.5MB versus 125KB as a simple C-string. While perhaps egregious in principle, I don't think this is really that big of a deal in practice. First, even a 400,000-word, novel-length document would "only" take up 50MB of memory in the absolute worst caseâ€”easily digestible by modern devices. Also, the eminently compressible CT format would be shrunk to a fraction of its full size during network transmission and storage. As a quick test, I saved a 125,000-atom, book-length CT to disk. Uncompressed, it took up 3.3MB; compressed via zip, a mere 570KB, or ~6x the size of the equivalent C-string.

While we could be a lot more efficient by using CTs in an operational CmRDT context, I think the resiliency of the CvRDT approach makes the memory footprint worth it. Just imagine being able to treat document merge between networked computers, physically local devices, different apps on the same machine, and perhaps even multiple threads in an almost identical manner! In the worst caseâ€”if the network is too congested to deal with these large filesâ€”we could set a target upload/download rate and exchange state snapshots less frequently when the CT gets too large. If this isn't acceptableâ€”and if random atom access isn't essential to the taskâ€”a RON-style compression strategy ought to be pursued.

## Missing Features & Future Improvements

Finally, it's worth noting a few features that my CT currently lacks.

For the moment, I've decided to omit garbage collection altogether. I'll mainly be using CTs in document-based applications with relatively small files and a limited number of collaborators, so the CTs will only be expected to grow until the document is complete. This is not just a matter of laziness: I'm very interested in building apps for mesh network style environments without any connectivity guarantees, and garbage collection immediately places constraints on the architecture of such a system. If you were using the CT for long-lived tasks such as database replication, messaging, or even preference syncing, you'd certainly want to implement the baselining strategy as described in the ORDT section. 

Some CRDTs offer native undo and redo functionality, but I'm quite happy with this being delegated to a higher level. For example, in the case of string CTs, `UITextView` seamlessly turns undo and redo commands into conventional deletes and inserts. Although this may result in excess garbage compared to explicit undo and redo operations, I think this sort of strictly local approach is more architecturally correct than the alternative. (I'm not in the camp that believes remote changes should be locally undoable.) As a performance tweak and compromise, it might make sense to keep new operations separate from the main CT and only merge them when some set amount of time has passed or when the user has paused their editing. If an undo happens, these pending operations could simply be dropped. My feeling is that this would significantly increase the complexity of certain functions in the CT and create a new vector for consistency issues, but it's certainly worth investigating.

The atom priority flag adds so much to the CT's expressiveness, and I think it could be improved even further by switching to a full integer. `INT_MIN` atoms would stick to their parent, `INT_MAX` atoms would float to the back, and the rest would be sorted in numeric order. Iâ€™m also eager to play around with alternate tree traversal ordersâ€”to see, for example, if a BFS weave might be faster than the current DFS weave for certain kinds of data. It's not yet clear to me whether these changes might break some of our invariants or intractably slow down merge.

One huge advantage to storing the weave as a contiguous array is that it could be memory-mapped and used as an object's backing data without having to deserialize it first. Better yet: if something like [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) were used to represent the atoms, this property could even be retained across the network! A user would be able to receive CT data from a peer or from disk, work with those bytes directly, and then send them right back the way they came. In preparation for this scenario, it would be a good idea to leave a bit of extra space in each atom's value for possible expansion of operations in the future. The validation function should also be made to throw an exception if an atom is discovered with an unknown case for its value enum.

My CT is only a dumb data structure, and as such, has no provisions for dealing with malicious users or Byzantine faults. A bad actor could easily spoof someone's UUID and corrupt the data structure with a few choice atoms. The `validate` method would likely catch this attempt, but there's no path for recovery after that. Consequently, production systems using CTs will likely need to deal with encryption and/or data recovery for when Bad Things happen. But that's almost certainly a concern for a different architectural layer, not the data structure itself.

# Conclusion

Whew, that was a bit more than I intended to write!

I didn't even think such a thing was possible, but CRDTs have proven to be that mythical, all-encompassing convergent data type I set out to find. You can use them in practically any computing environment and they will happily merge. They work offline just as well as online. They're relatively easy to understand without having to write a dissertation. They're composable with each other. You can use them for real-time collaboration, cloud sync, or local file sharingâ€”all without requiring any network coordination.

But even more remarkable is the discovery of Causal Trees and operation-based CRDTs. With this formulation of CRDTs, there's finally a way to understand, design, and implement arbitrary replicated data types. By breaking up conventional data types into atomic operations and arranging them in an efficient order, CRDTs can be made out of practically anything. Operations can be used as-is or condensed into state snapshots, combining all the benefits of CmRDTs, CvRDTs, and even OT. Version vectors can be used to perform garbage collection and past revision viewing in an almost trivial way, while uniquely-identified operations can be used to diff and blame any arbitrary change in a document's history, as well as to deeply link data structures to each other. Even conflict resolution can be precisely tailored to fit the needs of the app. And all this can be done while *simplifying* your architecture, since the paradigm is almost entirely functional!

Sure, you have some tradeoffs compared to server-based sync techniques. For instance, CRDT data is always "live", even while offline. A user could accidentally edit their document on two offline devices, then find that they've merged into a mess on reconnection without any way to revert. For good and ill, users will never see the familiar version conflict dialog box. The lack of a guaranteed server also gives malicious users a whole lot more power, since they can irrevocably screw up a document without any possibility of a rollback. Servers can better manage resources by sending partial updates or by only giving a user the data they actually need. You'd also be hard-pressed to avoid servers whenever large amounts of data are concerned, such as in screen sharing or video editing. Finally, CRDTs are fairly rigid structures that require pre-design and future proofing, and can't necessarily be layered on top of existing systems without significant refactoring.

A CT certainly won't be as fast or as bandwidth-efficient as Google Docs, for such is the power of centralization. But in exchange for a totally peer-to-peer computing future? A world full of systems finally able to freely collaborate with one another? Data-centeric code that's entirely free from network concerns?

I'd say: it's surely worth it!
