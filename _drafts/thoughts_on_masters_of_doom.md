# Thoughts on "Masters of Doom"

Recently, I had the pleasure of listening to an audiobook version of the book "Masters of Doom". This book is the story of John Carmack, John Romero, and a few others, who in the early 90's got together and created one of the most influential video game companies in the industry: id software.

First, I want to make it perfectly clear: I do *not* like the tone of id's games. All the demonic stuff — according to Carmack, a mix of his interest in D&D as well as a bit of a "fuck you" to religious folks — is disturbing to me. Furthermore, as my older self, I find the obsession with violence in id's games — perhaps the *source* of the extreme obsession with violence in games today — to be in poor taste. (With that said, as a kid, I reveled in it.)

But with that aside, the book was a joy to listen to, because it made me realize where, exactly, most of my videogame influences came from. Many gamers and game developers I know grew up with consoles. Nintendo, Sega, even Atari: the fun, naive blips and bloops of those colorful, joyous games were what they fell in love with.

My upbringing was not like this. My first encounters with videogames involved booting to a blinking cursor on a monolithic DOS screen and asking my dad to tweak some INI files in hope that my games would actually run.

It was playing games like Commander Keen, Wolfenstein, Raptor, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, Biomenace, and pretty much all the Apogee catalogue. Exploring worlds not punctuated with chipper music and happy bleeps, but full of foreboding, mystery, adventure. Listening to music inspired by metal songs of the day. Having no idea what was awaiting me on the next screen.

The shareware scene was cool, creative, and dark. Unlike the stuff coming out of Japan, it was — as the book details — often produced by troubled boys living in hostile home environments. From the very first success in the genre, that being id's own Commander Keen, the games felt deeper, darker, and heavier.

It was also such a cool story of indie success.

(And have no compunctions: this *was* the original indie scene, with games often being made independently by just one or two people. Heck, it's what got me so excited about modern indie games in the first place!)

Reading this book, I was teleported back to those early days. The joy I felt booting up Duke Nukem 3D for the first time. Looking for shareware on the internet. I felt like I was 5 years old again! In my mind, as I was reading the book, I was also fast-forwarding though my own history: Keen and Apogee Shareware, Wolf, yes, Doom, Duke 3D, Starctaft, Half-Life, the mod scene, Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament…! And then it tapered out.

But it also made me feel alive because I'm right at that point, too. That point where I have the resources and motivation to start working on my *own* world-changing stuff. Sure, Carmack and Romero were younger when they released their first games, but Tom Hall was older.

Although I do not like id, I *love* these games of my childhood. And as I'm learning as I grow older, these early influences are *everything*. They're your personality. They're your intersts. And as I gradually ease my way into game development, they're the main body of work from which I'll be pulling — the things that were fixed early on in my life as "fun".
