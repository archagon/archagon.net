# Useful Sites

There are a couple of sites I frequently find myself using while traveling. Some of these you probably know, and some you do not. I thought I'd list them here to have them all in one place.

## General

Numbeo

How much does a new city cost? How much does it cost compared to other cities? Numbeo answers theses questions elegantly and (in my experience) accurately. I find it particularly useful for figuring out what prices to aim for when it comes to housing.

## Housing

HostelWorld

Obvious â€” one of the best sites for hostel booking. Avoid additional fees by using the coupon code `asdf`. Pay $1 extra to cancel without a fuss. (HostelBookers does this for free, but their terms confuse me so I've never tried. HostelWorld also has more choices.)

AirBNB

I've written about using AirBNB here. In countries where the rent tends to be cheap, AirBNB can give you much nicer housing than hostels for about the same price. I haven't found it to be widespread in Paris or the UK, but Barcelona and Croatia seem to have it in spades.

Craigslist

## Travel

Rome2Rio

A great site for getting first-order estimates of trip expenses between cities. You can almost always go cheaper, but it's a good place to start.

GoEuro

Unlike other travel booking site, this one includes a number of different coaches, as well as potential cheap transfers for rail routes.
