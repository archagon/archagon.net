The whole etymology section is really interesting. This means that the word "ampersat", which I just found out is another name for @, is logically dubious, since it would "uncorrupt" to "&amp; <em>per se</em> at"**.

      <title>Gathering the Goods, Take 2</title>

<p><a href="/2013/8/28/gathering-the-goods">My first run at a packing list</a> was suprisingly solid: everything worked pretty much as intended and there wasn't anything I desparately missed or needed during my US trip. However, I misjudged the needs of my travel bag:</p>

<ul>
<li>I very rarely used my Silver Streak bag as a backpack, and when I did, it was just too heavy for prolonged use. (The total weight of all my equipment was almost 50 pounds.) As a result, I mostly ended up detatching the backpack and carrying the main bag on a shoulder strap, which was very uncomfortable.</li>
<li>All my important equipment rarely left my backpack. I hardly ever used the expanded compartment in the main bag for anything other than a few spare parts, souvenirs, and my Wacom tablet.</li>
<li>I gathered a lot of food ingredients during my travels, and to avoid a mess, I carried them in a separate cloth bag. There was never any need to store perishables in the main bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, I have replaced my Silver Streak with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYFABC2/?tag=arcwasher-20">Eagle Creek Switchback 22</a> (on sale). The Switchback does almost everything the Silver Streak does, but adds one vital feature for city use: wheels! Contrary to most of the advice I found on travel blogs, I desparately wished for wheels many times during my trip. (Maybe this would be different if I were spending long miles walking on unpaved roads, but the fact is that most of my traveling happens in modern cities and not the countryside.) The backpack half of the bag now serves as the store for all my tech equipment, while the main bag keeps all my clothes and accessories. Among other things, this consolidation means that I no longer have to move things from bag to bag when I'm leaving the main bag in a locker or on a bus/train/plane. Space is more tight than in the Silver Streak, but everything still fits. (At the moment, I've decided to roll up my jacket and clip it onto the handle, since cramming it in takes a bit too much effort.) The Switchback offers great flexibility in regards to transport: backpack zipped onto the main bag, backpack threaded onto the carrying handle, or backpack and main bag separate. (So far, I've found the most convenient option to be zipping the backpack onto the main bag and using the wheels. You can walk many miles like this without a problem.) There are many other details that make the Switchback feel like a high quality product, from the multipurpose outside straps to the secondary handle position all the way down to the stitching. It's clear that a lot of thought was put into the design. One minor annoynace is that the backpack straps have to be taken off the backpack to be used with the main bag, but since I'm mostly set on using the wheels, this isn't a big deal for me. Before I settled on the Switchback, I also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006P65P1W/?tag=arcwasher-20">Osprey Meridian</a>, but I was simply not able cram all my stuff in!</p>

<p>I also made a few other changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/eider-roc-de-chere-jacket-mens">Eider Roc de Chere</a> jacket in blue (also on sale). I made a bad call on my previous jacket: it was cold, scratchy, and most definitely not waterproof. I briefly considered applying more wax, which is what you're supposed to do to make a waxed cotton jacket more water resistant, but I decided it wasn't worth my time. Instead, I set out to find a no-compromise jacket this time around: waterproof, warm, comfortable, usable in all cold weather conditions, featuring a detatchable hood, and not horrendously ugly. (Most of the widely-recommended technical jackets and rain shells fell into that category for me.) I tried on a large number of different jackets from REI, Nau, Carhartt, Patagonia, Marmot, Eider, and Helly Hahn. Close contenders were the <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/833085/rei-montour-travel-jacket-mens">REI Montour</a> (green is not my favorite color), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007MKTRVY/?tag=arcwasher-20">Carhartt Grayling</a> (fit perfectly, but material felt plasticky), and the <a href="http://www.nau.com/mens/categories/jackets/temp-jacket-plaid-050m01.html">Nau Temp</a> (super comfy, but too warm and the fit wasn't right around the waist). The Roc de Chere's material is light enough for use even in warm-ish weather, and the color and material are fairly unique. Still, I wish it had buttons down the front! Is jacket envy a thing?</li>
<li>A pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002F00D9G/?tag=arcwasher-20">Adidas Duramo</a> slides. The Nike Benassis I had earlier were very comfortable, but the mesh lining took <em>forever</em> to dry out, to the point where, one, I simply couldn't shower in them if I had to leave the next day, and two, they actually had a propensity to mold! Their everlasting wetness also ensured that they could never double as slippers. Despite being made of a plastic-like material, my new Duramos are shockingly comfortable and dry out pretty much immediately. Somebody on the internet described them as "prison sandals", but no worries: all you have to do is lower your standards and you'll be going out in public in no time!</li>
<li>Two cloth bags: one for food (as mentioned earlier) and one for carrying dirty laundry around. They barely take up any space.</li>
<li>A very small tea cup from DAVID's Tea. I keep it in the same bag as my socks and glasses. Purchased in Toronto!</li>
<li>An <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D5T3QK4/?tag=arcwasher-20">Anker Astro E5</a> battery charger. Way too often, I would leave my house without having charged my phone and then end up desparately looking for a power outlet by the end of the day. With this device, I always have some extra charge on me. (Quite a bit of extra charge, actually.) It's also useful for charging all my small electronics when I'm too far from an outlet, or when I want to keep my belongings close to me in a hostel. An essential gadget.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9B8V5M/?tag=arcwasher-20">tiny Lightning cable</a> for my keychain. It bends in a way that allows me to hook up my iPhone to the aformentioned battery charger in my jacket pocket without having to deal with cable spaghetti.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000056VTW/?tag=arcwasher-20">small multitool</a>, consisting mostly of pliers and screwdrivers. No knives, so it's (nominally) TSA-safe.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056B9U0Y/?tag=arcwasher-20">ShedRain Windjammer</a> umbrella, based on last year's recommendation on <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-umbrella/">The Wirecutter</a>. London Fog's umbrella was awful and broke after about a week of use.</li>
<li>A long <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BU7U0W/?tag=arcwasher-20">stainless steel mesh tea infuser</a>. Aside from a little metal tag which I bent out of the way, this thing fits perfectly into my Klean Kanteen and allows me to brew loose-leaf tea with plenty of room for leaf expansion. It's the only one of its kind that I was able to find! Every other teaball is either tiny or doesn't fit into the Kleen Kanteen.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E4MQODC/?tag=arcwasher-20">Logitech G602 wireless mouse</a>. It works well enough and eliminates an annoying stretch of cable. Sensitivity, tracking, and latency are great for gaming use. (In fact, I saw some measurements that put the latency on par with wired mice!) Battery lasts a month. Range is really iffy, but I'm only planning to use it next to my computer, so that's not really an issue.</li>
<li>A set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWD9LY6/?tag=arcwasher-20">collapsible compact chopsticks</a>. I occasionally find myself in situations where I could really use some sort of utensil, and these chopsticks get the job done in most situations. (Plus, they're great for munching on small, greasy foods like popcorn or chips!)</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009M3PIHQ/?tag=arcwasher-20">Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen</a> — just because it's sweet. <code>:)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Already, HoboPack Mark II feels so much more useful and refined. Onward to more adventures!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Hosting a Blog</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/6/8/on-hosting-a-blog</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've had a (rarely-updated) development blog at <a href="http://www.abstractrose.net">abstractrose.net</a> for about a year now. It runs on a self-hosted Wordpress installation over at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a>&nbsp;and pulls images from Amazon Web Services. Thanks to the maturity of the Wordpress codebase, managing it has been a snap. But the stress of learning about security, finding the right plugins, dealing with spam, worrying about SEO, and other fiddly factors is still significant. And even though NearlyFreeSpeech hosts their own Apache, PHP, and MySQL services, it still took a couple of full days to get everything up and running. (Guilty: I'm a web development newbie.)<br></p><p>So for my personal blog, I've decided to try out Squarespace. They seem to sponsor all my favorite tech podcasts, and at only 8 bucks a month, they're only slightly more expensive than my current NearlyFreeSpeech/AWS costs. I intend to eventually move the whole thing over to another Wordpress install, but for now, I think the easy solution is the best one. I don't have time to fiddle — I just want to write something!</p><p>&nbsp;(Incidentally, this means that I'll be moving most of my programming and sysadmin talk over to the <a href="https://alexei-baboulevitch.squarespace.com/a-few-pointless-thoughts/?category=Programming">Programming category</a> here. The Abstract Rose blog will be devoted solely to game development.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Robocopy: it's not as scary as it looks!</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/6/16/robocopy-its-not-as-scary-as-it-looks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/51be7beae4b090c42fe54e4d/1371438059771/Robocopy.gif" alt=""/>
  

<p>(OK, so I know a <em>true</em>&nbsp;sysadmin would be talking about the wonders of rsync in this post, but please bear with me. This was a Windows problem and I wanted to use the right Windows tool for the job.)</p><p>I recently got a <a href="http://www.synology.com">Synology</a> NAS unit, and I needed to copy a couple of terabytes worth of data from my external NTFS drives over to the new RAID array. What to do? First of all, it might seem obvious to most of you, but I just want to make it clear: Windows file copy was simply not an option. Among other nasty things, my drives contained backed up user directories from a bunch of old Windows installs, meaning that they were riddled with broken permissions, confused symbolic links and NTFS junction points, and paths that were somehow too long for Windows to handle. Windows file copy would have choked about halfway through.</p><p>No, this was a job for some serious command line jujitsu. And thankfully, Windows has a built-in tool that was perfect for the job: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145(v=ws.10).aspx">robocopy</a>. Just like rsync, robocopy has dozens of incomprehensible flags that you need to spend hours studying to fully understand. Fortunately, I've whittled them down to an abridged summary in case you find yourself in a similar situation.</p><p>To clarify, here are the options I needed:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>NTFS backup privileges. This was required to allow Windows to copy every single file, regardless of whatever mangled permissions they had set.</li><li>Ignore symbolic links. Since I was copying the full contents of my drives, the symbolic links would have been redundant. Furthermore, since these drives were used on Windows only, I didn't have any symbolic links that I created myself. The only ones that were there were hidden Windows symbolic links that enabled backwards compatibility (or something).</li><li>Ignore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_junction_point">NTFS junction points</a>. Same reasoning as above.</li><li>(Danger Will Robinson! Without these two options, your robocopy may well run into an infinite loop with Windows system directories, as mine did when I was still figuring out what to do.)&nbsp;</li><li>Ignore system files. The only system files I had were Windows files that I had no reason to copy.</li><li>Remove hidden attributes from files. I was copying these drives strictly for the data, and I wanted to start with a clean slate.</li><li>Remove existing permissions and replace with default permissions. Same reasoning as above.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep a robust log.</li></ul><p>And here's what my robocopy call ended up looking like. Simply boot up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">PowerShell</a>&nbsp;in admin mode and give it a go. (The normal command prompt should work too, but you might have to fiddle with the formatting a bit.)<br></p><p></p><noscript><p><em>To see this Gist, please use a browser that supports Javascript.</em></p></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/archagon/5791332.js"></script><p>robocopy appears to work by first doing a depth-first run through the entire tree, creating directories as it goes. It then copies the actual files in the same traversal order. Do note that the console log isn't always real-time; it occasionally takes it a while to catch up to the written log.</p><p>One caveat, from my understanding, is that robocopy doesn't automatically checksum copied files. If you want to be extra, 100% sure that everything copied correctly, I suggest using a tool like <a href="http://corz.org/windows/software/checksum/">checksum</a>.&nbsp; (I know it's a bit, uh, hacker-y looking, but it gets the job done quickly and efficiently, minus a few issues with Russian text.)</p><p></p><p>And as a bonus, here's a command you can run if Windows refuses to delete a directory due to the path length of some files contained inside! (This can happen sometimes with deeply nested folders.) Simply create an empty directory and mirror it into the directory you wish to clear. robocopy does not adhere to the same constraints as Windows file copy. (I am not responsible for any unintended data loss that may occur.)<br></p><noscript><p><em>To see this Gist, please use a browser that supports Javascript.</em></p></noscript>

<p>On the tenth floor of the Central building, from behind the saftey of the honeycomb window lattice, you can enjoy the ethereal imprint of the raindrops against the brusque geometry of the downtown skyscrapers.</p>

<p>When your workday is over, you can take a stroll down south and walk along the waterline.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/526c9652e4b0b725baaf85ca/1432941224495//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>The wooden piers creak quietly as the boats come in and out of the docks.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/526c969ce4b0b725baaf8606/1432941232236//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>On the opposite side of the Space Needle, <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/9/4/seattle-from-below">Kerry Park has some fantastic views of the skyline</a>. From there, if you're as entranced by industrial equipment as I am, you can walk a little bit further north towards Queen Anne Hill. Little roads and staircases coexist with grandiose mansions in this well-to-do neighborhood.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/526c976de4b0931c94028401/1432941231675//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>On the very top are three broadcast antennas, reaching towards the distant sky.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/526c96e5e4b0b725baaf863d/1382848258250//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>The walk back towards the water is quite beautiful, with the city unfurling right before your feet.</p>

<p>Next time: a visit to the university and a trip up a tower!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>E-book PDFs from a buncha scans: easier than you might think!</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/6/9/e-book-pdfs-from-a-buncha-scans-easier-than-you-might-think</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/51be6219e4b020693fe234d6/1371431449877/iTextImage.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>I've been doing some serious hardcore scanning lately, and now I'd like to enjoy the fruits of my labor on my iPad. What to do? Obviously, reading image by image is a crappy option. A typical e-book format like .epub might be OK, but in its current incarnation it's really more optimized for text than image-heavy content. So PDF is clearly the way to go. (Well, I suppose you could also use a comic book format like .cbr and .cbz, but there's no way your average reader would be able to use it.)<br></p><p>And how exactly does one create a PDF? If you're starting from scratch, you might use something like Adobe Acrobat. But this isn't really a good choice for lumping a bunch of images together, since it costs $$$ and also applies all sorts of nasty behind-the-scenes transformations that you probably don't want. Ideal would be a simple tool that lets you combine images, one or two per page, at their native resolution, with no additional compression. And it should require as little fiddling as possible.<br></p><p>Fortunately, there are PDF frameworks out there that can be controlled entirely through code. I've done some looking, and it seems that <a href="http://itextpdf.com">iText</a> for Java is really the gold standard. (I'd prefer to use a scripting language, but setting up IntelliJ and adding the framework is hardly a hassle. The whole thing took me about 20 minutes to install and fully configure, though I admittedly already had Java installed.)<br></p><p>And here's what my thrown-together project looks like. It takes a bunch of scanned images in a directory and spits out a beautiful, perfect PDF, with the option of having two pages side-by-side.</p><p></p><noscript><p><em>To see this Gist, please use a browser that supports Javascript.</em></p></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/archagon/5748013.js"></script><p>(For a more complex example with zine scanning functionality — 2 pages per scan — take a look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/archagon/5737603">this Gist</a>. You might have to adjust the filename functions to better suit your workflow. This code is provided for educational purposes only!)</p><p>A couple of fun facts I learned about PDFs from this project:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>An Image object can be rendered multiple times without changing the size of the PDF. This indicates to me that PDFs have an asset store, where each asset can be rendered as many times as needed.</li><li>iText loads JPEGs <em>way</em> faster than PNGs. This implies that PDF supports JPEG natively, but not PNG. I don't know if PNGs get uncompressed, converted to another lossless format, or what.</li><li>(Of course, all this may be nonsense! I haven't exactly done my research.)</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>I've used this with great 
success to scan and digitize a bunch of yearbooks and zines. It's great to have a 
solution that gets you from point A to point B in the simplest possible 
way!</p><p></p><p>A huge thanks to Chris Haas on SuperUser for <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/331233/authoring-pdf-files-by-hand">putting me on the right track</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Gathering the Goods</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After living in a dark, enclosed space for a few years, I've decided to stretch my legs and travel around for a while. They say that routine makes your life pass by a lot faster. It certainly felt like the days were turning into months far too quickly at my previous job. Perhaps the secret to staying young forever, then, is simply a matter of taking in new experiences every day. Maybe it'll be possible to get some of those months back while looking down from the Sears Tower (sorry, Willis), wandering around the streets of Barcelona, or taking in the neon lights of Tokyo. <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/7/28/graphing-my-way-across-the-usa">I'm already a few weeks into a train trip around the United States and Canada</a>, and it's been wonderful waking up to a new skyline every few days. I'm also working on a few apps and games on the side, leeching Wi-Fi from coffee shops and turning libraries into makeshift offices. With any luck, these projects will turn into a viable career at some point in the near future, and then — I will be able to truly call myself a digital nomad!</p><p>(I'm going to try to update this blog pretty regularly, photos and everything. It's a bit difficult right now because I have a backlog of over 1000 photos, but I'll try to get the first few travel posts done within the week. If you'd like to stay updated, you can follow me on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/archagon">@archagon</a>) or subscribe to the <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts?format=rss">RSS feed</a> if&nbsp;<span>you're feeling nerdy.)</span></p>

<h1>A 70L Home</h1><p>My goal from the get-go in choosing a bag was to find one that I could take through an airport without having to check any luggage. (These are typically labeled as MLC, or maximum legal carry-on, and are sized around 22" x 14" x 9", or&nbsp;<span>≈4</span><span>5</span><span> liters.) It also had to have a backpack system, since I wasn't always planning on being in an environment with nice, flat sidewalks. After looking over all sorts of different recommendations (including </span><a href="http://www.rei.com/product/827970/rei-stratocruiser-wheeled-luggage-22">REI</a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/gear_hauling/porter_46">Osprey</a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.redoxx.com/air-boss/91018/product">Redoxx</a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/51615?page=quickload-travel-pack&amp;subrnd=0">L.L.Bean</a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.meipacks.com/TravelPacks01.html#voyage">MEI</a><span>, and </span><a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/switchback-22/d/1283">Eagle Creek</a><span>), I decided to try out the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0906.html">Tom Bihn Aeronaut</a><span>. While I loved the design and construction of this bag, it had a glaring issue: all my stuff simply wouldn't fit! I can really get behind the idea of minimal, single-bag travel as described by sites like </span><a href="http://www.onebag.com/">OneBag</a><span> and </span><a href="http://onebagger.squarespace.com/">One Bag, One World</a><span>, and I know that the </span><em>ideal</em><span> solution would be to jettison some of my belongings. However, I'm not just going on this adventure to see the world; I also want to do professional work and develop my programming and artistic skills while on the move, so I have no choice but to take more electronics than the average globetrotter. (As an upside, I get to take my SLR, which I wasn't originally planning to do.)</span></p><p>So I sold off the Aeronaut and got myself a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meipacks.com/TravelPacks01.html#silver1">MEI Silver Streak</a> instead. I couldn't find any reviews online, but the closely related MEI Voyageur was very highly regarded as a world travel bag. The Silver Streak was basically the same thing, minus the internal frame and with the addition of an expandable compartment (+ 16 liters) and a zip-on day pack (+ another 16 liters).</p><p>This bag is really perfect for my needs. When expanded, the second compartment comfortably stores all my extra electronics, and having the day pack on the outside frees up a lot of space in the main compartment. Without the expansion, the bag is carry-on size for airplanes and trains, and since most planes/trains allow you to take two carry-on items on board, I can put most of my extra junk into the day pack and avoid checking anything. Another feature that the Silver Streak has over the Aeronaut is the highly adjustable backpack system. There are at least six different pulls to make the pack sit perfectly on your back, and there are also proper waist supports that are (supposedly) load-bearing. The Aeronaut's backpack system is comparatively very simple and only has a bare strap for waist support.</p><p>One issue I've found with the Silver Streak is that it's very boxy when packed, meaning that the center of gravity is a bit farther out than what would be ideally comfortable. I'm packing a good 40+ pounds of stuff and I find myself having to take breaks every mile or so. (Plus, if somebody were to knock me on the forehead, I would fall over like a turtle!) But I don't know if an actual hiking pack would be any better, and it probably wouldn't be usable as carry-on anyway.&nbsp;<span>Another minor problem is that t</span><span>he Silver Streak feels much more flimsy compared to the Aeronaut. Whereas the Aeronaut has beautiful stitching and really interesting (almost three-dimensional) designs, the Silver Streak looks very homemade. The side handles in particular seem like they're barely attached, and I have a hard time trusting that they won't tear off at an inopportune moment. (MEI has been vetted by many travelers so I doubt it'll actually happen. It's more about the feel of the thing than the actual construction, though I'll certainly post any updates.)</span></p><p>One thing I kept from my Aeronaut purchase was the much-lauded stretchy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/TB0505.html">Absolute Shoulder Strap</a>. I spend maybe a quarter of my time carrying the Silver Streak over my shoulder, but it's more than enough to justify the expense for my shoulders and back. (Incidentally,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.levysleathers.com/product;cat,828;item,476;Straps-MNO1">my favorite guitar strap</a> is exactly the same way!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>My Earthly Possessions</h1><p>For a trip like this, one of the most important issues is packing everything as compactly as possible. After all, a carry-on-sized bag isn't really all that big. Based on traveler recommendations, I decided to go with a system of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YIPAGA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YIPAGA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">packing cubes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YIPBL4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YIPBL4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">clothes folders</a>. The cubes stack very well if you fill them to capacity, and it's nice to have the option of removing specific cubes and storing them outside the bag. For example, my biggest cube contains all my underwear and socks, and I usually keep it by my bedside. (Do note that the cubes become much less useful if they're not completely full, since the extra material gets in the way and you lose the ability to stack them.) The clothes folders work reasonably well for keeping clothes tightly compressed and relatively wrinkle-free, and the larger one even doubles as a hard bottom for my bag. (Both of the Eagle Creek folders contain removable plastic inserts.) I still have a lot of things that don't go into cubes or envelopes (jacket, bathrobe, towel, various self-contained accessories), but it's hard to completely maximize the usable space otherwise — especially around the edges.</p><p>Some travelers recommend buying quick-drying and wrinkle-free synthetics for shirts and pants, but I didn't want to compromise on my wardrobe just because I was on the move. In terms of overwear, I'm currently carrying a pair of jeans, two pairs of chinos, a pair of shorts, three button-up shirts, two polos, two t-shirts, two sweaters, and a jacket. Even with everything air-drying at once, I haven't had any real issues. (At worst, my clothes are still slightly damp after a few days.) I did, however, concede to buying travel socks and underwear, since (reportedly) cotton takes forever to dry and retains odor very easily. Based on many raving reviews, I decided to go with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0MMYY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001M0MMYY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">ExOfficio boxer briefs</a>&nbsp;for underwear and a sampler set of various merino brands (<a href="http://www.socksaddict.com/ProductFinder.aspx/1/80000010%5eSmartWool">SmartWool</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker/e/2210208011/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">Icebreaker</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.socksaddict.com/ProductFinder.aspx/1/80000010%5eDarn+Tough">Darn Tough</a>) for socks. So far, the results have been very positive. As advertised, both the ExOfficio synthetics and the merino wool garments dry rapidly, feel comfy, and don't need to be washed quite as frequently as cotton clothing. (Don't worry, I rotate them daily and wash them often anyway.) With SmartWool socks in particular,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smartwool.com/mens/socks-2/phd-outdoor-medium-crew-1.html">there are a few models engineered for maximum hiking comfort</a>, though the one pair I have doesn't seem to make&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;much of a difference. (Certainly feels neat, though.) In regards to thickness, three of my socks are light or even ultralight and two are medium. I think the thin ones have proven more comfortable so far (even medium feels a bit "wintery"), but I'm admittedly traveling in fairly warm climates. A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EN0VE8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000EN0VE8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">stretchy laundry line</a>&nbsp;has proven very useful for drying my small items. (Simply loop the first end through itself around your bedpost, then circle the other end around another bedpost and secure with a fork.) Although I packed for it, I haven't had the chance to try hand washing yet: most of my hostels have had washing machines and sometimes even free detergent. (Frankly, I hope it stays that way.)</p><p>I didn't want to pack multiple sets of shoes, so I had to find a pair that was comfy and easy to walk in, but also classy enough to use in restaurants and other more formal establishments. There are plenty of brands that&nbsp;<em>mostly</em>&nbsp;fit these criteria, including Ecco, Mephisto, Rockport, Bostonian, and Cole Haan Air. Unfortunately, it's a little difficult to find a pair that has a truly classic look while still having sneaker-like comfort. After trying about a dozen different shoes, I ultimately settled on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zappos.com/ecco-atlanta">Ecco Atlantas</a>. They have a soft mesh lining on the inside, ankle padding, and plush insoles, making them very comfortable for all-day use. I've taken them on hikes and into restaurants and they've performed admirably in both kinds of situations. (A few people have recommended Dr. Scholl's insoles, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet. I also don't think they let you take them through airport security.)</p><p>For bathing, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007WSHENO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007WSHENO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">thin bathrobe</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.basegear.com/sea-to-summit-dry-lite-towel-sale.html">microfiber towel</a>&nbsp;have proven invaluable. Many hostels charge for towels so carrying your own can save you a lot of money, and a bathrobe is great for rolling out of bed in the morning and heading to bathroom with your supplies already in your pockets. The Sea to Summit towel I got absorbs water very well and dries really quickly. I also got a pair of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00550IC6O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00550IC6O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">Nike slides</a>&nbsp;for shower use as well as general loafing. They're very comfortable, but I've found that they take too long to dry due to the mesh lining. (Might look into getting an all-rubber pair later.) I use a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YIM04K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YIM04K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">shoe sac</a>&nbsp;to tote them around, which saves a lot of space in my bag. For washing, I use bar soap with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z4IV70/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005Z4IV70&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">loofah soap saver</a>. It's a bit messy and the soap seems to run out quickly, but I want to carry around as few gels as possible. For hair use, I highly recommend the the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Shampoos/liquid-shampoos,en_US,sc.html">Lush shampoo bar</a>&nbsp;along with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lushusa.com/Shampoo-Bar-Tin/22016,en_US,pd.html">tin</a>. (This is a tip I picked up from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neverendingvoyage.com/how-to-travel-long-term-with-only-carry-on-luggage/">Never Ending Voyage</a>.)</p><p>There are a handful of accessories I've found myself using almost every day. My two small&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1FGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WB1FGK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">cable locks</a>&nbsp;are almost always attached to my main bag, while the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZOUB5A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000ZOUB5A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">larger lock</a>&nbsp;is either hanging on my locker or securing the bag to a nearby post via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00165PA3A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00165PA3A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">a small bit of bike lock cable</a>. My&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AJI8MO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004AJI8MO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">headlamp</a>&nbsp;is great for when I come back at two in the morning and all my hostelmates are asleep. My&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0080SIJD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0080SIJD4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">power strip</a>&nbsp;doubles as an extension cord and has allowed me access to all sorts of out-of-the-way outlets. (It also has international plugs for easier sharing, though I haven't had a chance to use them yet.) My&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093ISEPI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0093ISEPI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">Klean Kateen</a>&nbsp;is probably my most important asset. Not only is it constantly in use, but it also doubles as an electric kettle with my snap-on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I8VE68/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000I8VE68&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">immersion heater</a>&nbsp;(which is coincidentally shaped almost perfectly for the Klean Kanteen lip). <strong>(Warning: due to this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QT7GEU4F0NM6">recent review</a> warning that some immersion heaters conduct electricity into the water, I urge you to avoid this approach.)</strong> The Kanteen I have trades off a bit of volume for vacuum insulation, making it ideal for enjoying hot beverages without burning your fingers or for keeping drinks cool all day. I also indulged myself a little and brought along a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GE2XF8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002GE2XF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">food thermometer</a>&nbsp;for measuring ideal water temperature for tea. Call it excessive, but it's great to be able to brew perfect green or white tea on the go!</p><p>I wanted to bring along a pair of higher-end headphones, but I wasn't sure whether to go with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009FHFFIG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009FHFFIG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">Sennheiser Momentums</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009A6D034/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009A6D034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">Sony MDR-1RBTs</a>. After traveling with the 1RBTs for a few weeks, I can definitely say that they're a fantastic option. The Bluetooth functionality is very useful (especially in cramped quarters), the sound stage is pretty wide, the audio quality is very good (<a href="http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/solid-sony-mdr-1r-mdr-1rbt-and-mdr-1nc">though you can do a bit better in that price range if you're willing to give up wireless</a>), the earcups fold flat for easy packing, and to top it off they're extremely comfortable and warm. I'd almost say they're worth it for that last point alone: it's so nice to pop them on in the library and feel the world melt away around you!</p><p>If you take a lot of photos (and&nbsp;<em>especially</em>&nbsp;if your camera supports RAW), please do yourself a favor and buy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop-lightroom/buying-guide.html">Adobe Lightroom</a>. It's a program for organizing and adjusting ("developing") your photos, and it's somewhat unique in that every adjustment you make is non-destructive. This means that you can fiddle with and undo any changes to your heart's content, experimenting with different settings as you go. The settings are also very intelligent, allowing you to (for example) bring out just the shadows or adjust the contrast for only the mids. The organizer features tagging, location data, metadata filters, categories, and other great features that make your photos easy to catalogue and sort through. And it's cross-platform! It's really changed the way I do photography and made me much more excited about carrying around an SLR.</p><p>A note on online retailers: Amazon is great for most items, but I've found two specialized retailers that are even better for a few specific things.&nbsp;<a href="http://basegear.com/">Basegear.com</a>&nbsp;has fantastic prices, excellent supply (colors and sizes), and quick shipping for many travel items (especially Sea to Summit), while&nbsp;<a href="http://socksaddict.com/">SocksAddict.com</a><span>&nbsp;is great for mixing and matching different kinds of socks, especially merino. Do be sure to check them out if you're planning a long trip.</span></p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After living in a dark, enclosed space for a few years, I've decided to stretch my legs and travel around for a while. They say that routine makes your life pass by a lot faster. It certainly felt like the days were turning into months far too quickly at my previous job. Perhaps the secret to staying young forever, then, is simply a matter of taking in new experiences every day. Maybe it'll be possible to get some of those months back while looking down from the Sears Tower (sorry, Willis), wandering around the streets of Barcelona, or taking in the neon lights of Tokyo.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/7/28/graphing-my-way-across-the-usa">I'm already a few weeks into a train trip around the United States and Canada</a>, and it's been wonderful waking up to a new skyline every few days. I'm also working on a few apps and games on the side, leeching Wi-Fi from coffee shops and turning libraries into makeshift offices. With any luck, these projects will turn into a viable career at some point in the near future, and then — I will be able to truly call myself a digital nomad!</p><p>(Lots more, including purchasing decisions and a full inventory list, if you click through below!)&nbsp;</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey, nice blog! i am interested to hear how the pack held up for your trip, are you still happy with it, pro's/con's and whatnot. i am looking at this pack or the voyager and can't decide between the two, the voyager looks to me like it has more padding on the back near the hips, but i like the idea of a day pack, how did you find wearing this pack for extended periods of time? was its safe with all your electronic gear and, especially the laptop? thanks, oli.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey! The pack held up great, but I decided to switch to wheeled luggage instead on account of the weight of all my gear: http://beta-blog.archagon.net/2013/08/28/gathering-the-goods-part-2/</p>

<p>50lb of weight is far too much to carry around on your shoulders, I'm afraid! So I don't really have any impressions of the bag under normal (30lb or less) use.</p>

<p>Everything was safe, but I always made sure to keep my electronics in the day pack and on my person at all times. The zippers lock up nicely, though you really can't rely on a zipper lock to keep your stuff safe.</p>

<p>Pros: really solid construction, lots of space, great features (especially the day pack and expanding main compartment). Cons: when full, center of mass is far from your body (cube shape), handle isn't great, somewhat dull looking. I think the construction of the Silver Streak and the Voyageur are very similar but you can always call MEI and ask for details if you have concerns.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/7/28/graphing-my-way-across-the-usa</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been planning a trip around the United States for the past few weeks. I've got my bag, my clothes, my documents and even my <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/72">portable bucket</a>. Now all I need is... an itinerary? Rats!</p><p>Since this trip is intended to be a preliminary journey before I head off to more distant lands, I want to take most of it by train. It'll be nice to see a fairly sizable portion of the country from the window. I might end up regretting it when I'm sitting in a 48-hour Amtrak car that's delayed in the middle of the boonies, but hey, it's better than refreshing MetaFilter or Hacker News for hours at a time.<br></p><p>I drew up my initial plan a few hours ago. Seeing as how I didn't want to meticulously plan every detail of my drip ahead of time, I decided that a flow chart would be the best way to do it. (It's like a choose your own adventure book in real life!) The best online tool I could find for this purpose was called <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com">LucidChart</a>, by virtue of the fact that it featured automatic curved arrows. Free for personal use! Really cool.<br></p><p>Here's the semi-finished map (click for larger):<br></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">That Vancouver to Toronto route looks particularly tempting. If I can snag a </span><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/deals/vancouver-toronto" style="line-height: 1.6em;">good deal on a ticket</a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, I'd love to go San Francisco → Portland (?) → Seattle → Vancouver → Victoria (?) → Toronto → Montreal → Quebec City → Boston → New York → Philadelphia → Chicago → Minneapolis → New Orleans → Houston (?) → Austin → San Francisco. Otherwise, I'll have to go from Seattle to Minneapolis and probably go to Toronto from Chicago. Either way, should be tons of fun! I'll be sure to take lots of photos.</span><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>24 Hours on the Coast Starlight</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/9/1/24-hours-on-the-coast-starlight</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday the 11th, 8:23pm — the day of my first departure. Having decided that Portland probably wasn't worth a detour, I booked the Coast Starlight to Seattle, 24 hours by rail, along with another train from Vancouver to Toronto on the 23rd. (More on that later.) My station of departure was the San Jose Diridon. The train arrived a bit early<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, so I spent about an hour exploring the different cars and waving goodbye to my family.</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/5223fcafe4b0750ab14418b3/1432941229340//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>I had never been on the Amtrak before, so I didn't really know what to expect. Fortunately, the train was very comfortable to travel on — certainly much better than the toil of flying. I particularly appreciated the fact that my seat was about a hundred times bigger and more comfortable than your typical economy seat on an airplane, although sadly it came without the ability to squish the passenger behind me with my boisterous reclining. Most of my time was spent in the observation car<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, which featured dozens of small tables with abundant power outlets and fantastic floor-to-ceiling windows that provided</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;a magnificent view into the constantly changing world outside. A perfect makeshift office!</span></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/52261272e4b05ca11e68d99a/1432941223994//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p><span>This was the first opportunity to test the usefulness of all the garbage I packed, and I was glad to confirm that most of my needs were accounted for. My tea-making equipment (...yes, tea is a need!) was particularly comforting: despite the lack of hot water on the train, I was able to brew myself a few canisters of Earl Grey and enjoy the view in the&nbsp;</span><em>British manner</em><span>. My power strip was very helpful with my multitude of chargers and even doubled as an extension cord, allowing me to snag a scenic but out-of-the-way seat. I was very glad that I brought my own Wi-Fi on board (via iPad hotspot), since the train internet could in no way be relied upon. (After all, what's a beautiful view without a browser window open to your favorite social networking site?) I was almost always wearing my jacket, and it even doubled as a makeshift blanket/cocoon at night — the train was chilly!</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span>One small tragedy is that I forgot my pre-selected bottle of beer, leaving my bird-shaped bottle stopper without a purpose in the world. Steps have been taken to ensure that this mistake does not happen again.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/52261324e4b07f56d0a42769/1432941226778//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p><span>The views along the route were quite good: small towns in California, farmy looking places in Oregon, green forested mountains in Washington. I particularly enjoyed the last leg of the trip, where we sailed along the coast of Puget Sound through Tacoma and straight into the city center of Seattle. Unfortunately, due to the combination of the train's speed and the reflections in the windows, it was difficult to take photos along the way. Even a shutter speed of 640 had plenty of motion blur in the foreground!</span></p><p></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Despite the fact that the seats reclined quite far, it was hard to sleep in coach. I was only out for a couple of hours at most. Two days like this would be fine; more might be tough. Fortunately, the longest of my Amtrak routes is around two days long, and my four day VIA Canada route is in a sleeper berth.</span><br></p><p>Anyway. Onwards to Seattle!</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle From Below: Day One at the Pike Place Market</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/9/4/seattle-from-below</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's hard to say enough good things about Seattle. You have the verdant scenery of the northwest; the familiar brick buildings and cobblestone streets; the twisting coastline of the Sound. There are the plentiful waterfront walks, the numerous indie eateries, the beautiful University of Washington campus, the hills and the hilltop views.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The people are nice and it's not too crowded, even when you head to the more touristy parts of town.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Everything seems to be within walking distance — or a short bus ride away, at worst.&nbsp;</span><span>Beer and coffee are consumed in copious amounts. And all this before the backdrop of the magnificent Mount Reinier, head high in the clouds.</span></p><p></p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1000.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/522d2baee4b04287ea7a8ec5/1378692016307/IMG_6643.jpg" alt="A beautiful view from Kerry Park."/> A beautiful view from Kerry Park.[/caption] 
  

<p>I spent the first half of my stay at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-hostel-seattle-seattle">City Hostel</a>, conveniently located downtown, right by the water. The walk from the train station was about two miles, testing my endurance with the 40 pound backpack for the first time. (I managed, albeit slowly.) Inside the hostel, there were three floors full of mostly four-person dorms, plus a basement floor with some extra areas. Each residential floor had its own kitchen and a few individual showers and bathrooms. The ground floor additionally had a small library and a computer lab, and the basement contained a homemade theater, table seating, and a patio. Each room was decorated with murals, and ours was even signed by an artist. Aside from the key cards, there wasn't much newness to the place: the paint was peeling a bit, the furniture was rickety and mismatched, and a variety of random objects were scattered throughout the common areas — books on socialism, disturbingly untuned guitars, out-of-place succulents. Yes, my friends — it was certainly my kind of place!<br></p>

<p>I spent a lot of my lunch money at the Pike Place Market, which happened to be just a five minute walk away from the hostel. Even though it's considered by some locals to be a tourist trap, it also reportedly has some of the best small eateries in lower Seattle. I really enjoyed all the different chowders at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pike-place-chowder-seattle">Pike Place Chowder</a>, and I can even say that the New England variety was better than any I've had in Boston or San Francisco. The <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-panier-very-french-bakery-seattle">Le Panier</a> café had some really good pastries and espresso, and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/piroshky-piroshky-seattle">Piroshky Piroskhy</a> featured some very authentic Russian-style baked goods. (Though I take issue with the fact that they transliterated their&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_(Cyrillic)">ж</a>-s as "sh"-s!) I also had a great bowl of tomato soup and mac-and-cheese at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/beechers-handmade-cheese-seattle">Beecher's Handmade Cheese</a> while watching industrial machinery churn milk through the observation window.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/522d2bf1e4b0832d81b7ffc3/1378692082999/IMG_6964.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>One of the things I liked most about Pike Place was just how illogical it was. The market is surrounded by roads of different elevations and angles, some of which intersect in surprising ways. You can turn a corner and suddenly find yourself walking through an arch at a sharp downwards incline towards the water, while different side stairs spiral out into yet-undiscovered areas above and below you. There are also small alleys that wind through the surface level buildings, each with their own confusing geography.</p><p>Inside the market, it's simply impossible to find anything. Each floor is full of winding passages leading to a variety of shops, expressed with no thought to any order. Just when you think you've found every shop on a floor, you run into a hidden corridor leading to another dozen. If you're looking for a landmark, good luck: when I was meeting up with my friends, they kept telling me that they were by the "bronze pig" and the "neon sign". I later discovered at least three different instances of each.</p><p></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/52277e75e4b0ca162dba5292/1378319991590//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  


  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/52277e87e4b0fe83e361a7a7/1378320009041//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>As a result of this mess, walking through the market was rather delightful. You never knew what you would find around every corner! Sometimes it was a makeshift stand with hand-drawn greeting cards. Other times it was a street musician playing in front of a bunch of eateries. Occasionally, you'd run into a winding line that acted as a recommendation for an otherwise unassuming joint. Vendors were yelling out stuff about caviar while throngs of tourists eagerly snapped their photos. Hand-written signs advertising fresh fish and chowder were plastered all over the walls, alongside bits of sculpture and swaths of murals. <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Compare this to something like Fisherman's Wharf, where everything is new and orderly and almost feels like an amusement park. However gimmicky the market might be, at least it&nbsp;<em>feels</em>&nbsp;authentic.</span></p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/522d2c30e4b0832d81b8002d/1378692145846/IMG_6225.jpg" alt=""/>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The mix of the calming waterfront, several avenues of interesting stores, and the nearby skyline of the financial district made this area a great layman's introduction to Seattle. I'm really glad I got to see the other parts of town, but as a central hub, the City Hostel was right in the middle of the action.</span><br></p><p>Up next: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qam9JBk5Oig">Alexei goes visiting</a>, and a trip to Fremont!&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Seattle: Of Lands and Locals</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/10/14/seattle-of-lands-and-locals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a couple of wonderful days in Seattle hanging out with an old friend, a new friend, and a baby. </p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dba22e4b0fb1ebe6dda48/1432941231298//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>We met up a few times at my friend's house for dinner and board games. The place was usually brimming with family and friends (great folks, the lot of them) as well as their children, who ran around and did whatever it is that children do. Looking back, I've spent a surprisingly small amount of time around kids ever since I was a kid myself, and it was inspiring to once again experience the kind of unreserved enthusiasm and curiosity that tends to fade as you get older. (One of them even asked if my camera was a Nikon!) I was also happy to see that the next generation of gamers was being raised by people with impeccable taste: Rayman Legends, Duck Tales, Fez.</p>

<p>My friend's 1-year-old was particularly interesting to watch. I never realized how quickly toddlers picked up on things! You showed him how to use the shutter release on your camera, and suddenly he was almost snapping photos all by himself. One time, I poked his finger when he was pointing at me; a second later, he was touching his own two fingers together, seemingly fascinated by the concept. Having recently spent about 5 minutes trying to turn off a hostel TV set, I was clearly outclassed. Kids and their pliable brains.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dba5ce4b0fb1ebe6ddb90/1432941227587//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>Anyway, it was a lot of fun. As a souvenir, I even managed to pick up some arcane knowledge, including how to shuffle cards <a href="http://cardshuffles.com/riffle-shuffle.htm">the cool flippy way</a> and how to play mahjong just like an old Japanese lady. (I say Japanese because the rules my friend taught me were for the Japanese variety of the game, which I didn't even know was a thing. Also, mahjong is really fun!)</p>

<p>The four of us also took a short day trip to Fremont.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dbf53e4b0f5b115b89398/1432941237429//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>This charming little neighborhood is located on the north shore of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, crossed by the Aurora and Fremont Bridges. The feeling here is a lot more laid-back than in lower Seattle, brought on in part by the tree-lined streets and the calming waterfront. (Of course, it also helps to have a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll">bearded</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Lenin,_Seattle">guardians</a> watching over you.)</p>

<p>After stopping by a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/vienna-mae-coffee-seattle">parking lot coffee shack</a>, we crossed the Fremont Bridge and walked along the shore in hopes that the bridge would salute for a passing ship. Sure enough, we weren't disappointed.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dbac3e4b0fb1ebe6ddc7d/1432941223609/IMG_6509.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>Up close, the bridge revealed its beautiful geometry and faded colors.</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dbb31e4b0fb1ebe6ddd7f/1432941230109//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>We also stopped by a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dusty-strings-seattle">neat little music store</a>. They had everything from electric bass ukuleles to wooden dulcimers. I briefly considered buying a harmonica to round out my hobo-nouveaux lifestyle, but ultimately decided against it.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/525dbb6be4b0607b1e3730db/1432941238378//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>A huge thanks to my friend for the warm welcome! I couldn't have asked for a better way to start my journey.</p>

<p>Next: more Seattle, Vancouver, and a bunch of other things that have been on the backburner for a while. (I promise the next article won't take nearly as long as this one.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle: You're Probably Tired of Seattle By Now</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/12/5/seattle-youre-probably-tired-of-seattle-by-now</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week into my Seattle visit, I moved from the downtown City Hostel to the confusingly-named <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-hotel-seattle">Hotel Hotel Hostel</a> in the Fremont neighborhood. (The very same neighborhood I had visited with my friends <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/10/14/seattle-of-lands-and-locals">a few days prior</a>.) The streets were quiet and a little quirky, the nearby water gently lapped at the shoreline, and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/theo-chocolate-seattle">smell of chocolate</a> followed you down the street. It felt a little like being on vacation. (Of course, having a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/brouwers-cafe-seattle">fantastic gastropub</a> down the street helped. Did I mention I hate the word "gastropub"? It sounds like somewhere you go to cleanse your body of toxins. But I digress...)</p>

<p>I found myself on the same side of the canal as the University of Washington, one of my favorite university campuses. It was raining when I first visited many years ago, turning the entire Red Square into an enormous skyward mirror. The sun was defiantly shining this time around, but the architecture was no less spectacular.</p>

<p>I spent maybe a little too much time wearing my metaphorical beret.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a sign on the nearby wall helped ground me in my present reality.</p>

<p>Turned out the University had a wonderful foot trail that went right along the Montlake Cut, which connects Portage Bay and Lake Washington. I spent a while watching the boats ebb and flow beneath the nearby bridge.</p>

<p>Lots of people were out that day sailing and enjoying the weather.</p>

<p>As the coda to my Seattle adventure, I payed a visit to the Smith Tower. It might no longer be the tallest building in town, but it's one of the oldest skyscrapers in the US, if the guides are to be believed. After taking a ride in a vintage elevator (operator and all!), I spent a lovely hour wandering around the airy observation deck and and soaking in the full panorama of the city, 400 feet above the ground.</p>

<p>All in all: great city, fast shipping, A+++, would visit again.</p>

      <title>Late 2013 15" Macbook Pro: Intel Iris Pro 5200 vs. Nvidia 750m (And Other Stories)</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/12/19/late-2013-15-macbook-pro</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096VD85I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096VD85I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">high-end 15" Macbook Pro</a>. The 13" model I was using before had served me with faith and dignity over the years, but as my appetite for high-performance apps increased, the poor guy just couldn't keep up like it used to. In the past, I would have only considered upgrading to another 13" laptop, but a lot has changed over the years. Computers have slimmed down. I've slimmed up. A 15" device just didn't seem like the back-breaking monster it used to be.</p>

<p>The other big factor in my decision was graphics performance. Among all the Macbooks currently available, the high-end 15" Macbook Pro is the only one with a discrete graphics chip still inside. You get access to an integrated Intel Iris Pro 5200 for everyday use, but the OS can also switch you over to a powerful Nvidia 750m when the polygons have to fly. </p>

<p>At first, I naturally assumed that the 750m would kick the 5200's butt; this was a separate ~40w component, after all. But as I started to dig through forum posts and benchmarks for my research, I discovered that while the Iris Pro usually lagged behind the 750m by 15%-50%, there were a few recorded instances where it matched or even surpassed the Nvidia chip! Some people blamed this on drivers, others on architecture. Were the numbers even accurate? I wanted to find out for myself.</p>

<p>There were a couple of specific questions I was looking to answer during my testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>How good is the maximum graphics performance of this machine?</li>
<li>How does the Iris Pro 5200 compare to the 750m?</li>
<li>How does Windows 7 VM (Parallels) graphics performance compare to native Windows 7 (Bootcamp)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3dmark">3DMark</h2>

<p>For my first set of benchmarks, I configured a Parallels VM to run off my Bootcamp partition with the following settings: 4 logical processors (which I think gives you 2 physical cores), 12GB RAM, 1GB video memory, DirectX 10, and 1440×900 resolution. (I also ran a test with 2 logical processors, which caused performance issues, and also with 8 logical processors, which caused my system to seriously freeze up.) I then installed the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/">3DMark demo</a> on Steam and ran the default suite of tests. Finally, I turned off the VM, changed the energy setting from "Better performance" to "Longer battery life" in order to make the VM use integrated graphics (verified with <a href="http://gfx.io">gfxCardStatus</a>), and ran the same tests again.</p>

<p>(Oh, before I give you my results, I should mention that none of these tests are scientifically rigorous. I tried to be as accurate as possible, but I'm no <a href="http://www.anandtech.com">Anand Shimpi</a>. Also, even though the results of my VM tests were consistent with everything else I tried, I'm not sure how much the numbers were skewed given that they were running through Parallels' DirectX to OpenGL layer.)</p>

<p>The Physics test only measures CPU speed and can thus be ignored. Insofar as benchmarks are concerned, it looks like the 750m's gains over the Iris Pro are moderate: 25% in the basic test and 9% in the more intensive test. Do note, however, that the second number is an average, and that Graphics Test 2 in Ice Storm also showed ~25% improvement.</p>

<p>I then ran the same test in native Bootcamp. Unfortunately, it's impossible to switch to integrated graphics in Windows, so this is only useful for comparing discrete performance between native and VM.</p>

<p>As one might expect, Bootcamp clobbers Parallels. The more demanding Cloud Gate benchmark shows much bigger gains than Ice Storm, implying that the VM is better suited to slightly older games.</p>

<p>3DMark in Bootcamp also added one more test at the end, possibly due to the fact that Parallels only supports DirectX 10. I'm putting it here for completion's sake.</p>

<p>Next, I downloaded the <a href="http://unigine.com/products/heaven/">Unigine Heaven</a> benchmark. This benchmark is very convenient because it can be run natively in both Windows and OSX, allowing us to make cross-platform comparisons.</p>

<p>First, I ran the same Parallels test that I did for 3DMark using Unigine's two built-in presets. Unfortunately, it turned out that the Extreme test didn't support tesselation in VM but <em>did</em> when run natively, forcing me to do a few custom runs on the other platforms with tesselation turned off. It also threw up errors when I tried to run the test in OpenGL or DirectX 9, so I had to stick to DirectX 11 in the VM.</p>

<p>A surprisingly significant result for the Extreme benchmark! Discrete performance is nearly twice as fast.</p>

<p>Next, I did the same test in OSX, using the ever-so-convenient <a href="http://gfx.io">gfxCardStatus</a> to switch between integrated and discrete graphics.</p>

<p>Yikes! Looks like running a benchmark tool in a VM, through Parallels's DirectX to OpenGL layer, and finally through the OSX OpenGL driver is somehow faster than running the same benchmark natively. On the other hand, the difference between integrated and discrete performance is a lot more consistent here. Like in the previous test, we see almost twofold gains.</p>

<p>Finally, I ran the same test in Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Looks like the difference between all three platforms for this particular benchmark isn't too significant.</p>

<h2 id="metrolastlight">Metro: Last Light</h2>

<p>For my next test, I decided to go a little crazy and give Metro: Last Light a go. Frankly, I wasn't even sure if Parallels was up to the task! As it turns out, modern VMs are a lot more powerful than they look.</p>

<p>Here are the presets I used with the handy MetroLLbenchmark.exe utility.</p>

<li>Preset 1: 1440×900, DirectX 10, low quality, AF 4×, low motion blur, SSAA off, PhysX off</li>
<li>Preset 2: 1440×900, DirectX 10, high quality, AF 16×, normal motion blur, SSAA off, PhysX off</li>
<li>Preset 3: 1920×1200, DirectX 10, high quality, AF 16×, normal motion blur, SSAA on, PhysX off</li>
</ul>

<p>And here are the results with the typical Parallels shenanigans.</p>

<p>As with Unigine, we see almost twofold gains when using discrete graphics. Makes sense: Metro is one of the most graphically intensive games on PC right now.</p>

<p>Next, I ran all my presets in Bootcamp.</p>

<p>

<p>I was surprised to see that the gain from running natively over running in VM was only around 50%. For a game like Metro, I expected native Windows to completely blow the VM away. You probably wouldn't want to run the game in Parallels due to the fact that it's a bit jittery and unstable, but still!</p>

<p>Just to see how far I could push this machine, I added a couple of modified runs: Preset 2 with SSAA on, and Preset 2 with PhysX on.</p>

</p>

<p>If you're going for performance, SSAA is clearly a killer. PhysX, on the other hand, doesn't make as much of an impact as I expected. Still might be worth turning off: I didn't notice anything different in the benchmark.</p>

<p>Just for kicks, I did one more batch of runs in DirectX 11 mode.</p>

<p>Whoa! It actually runs <em>better</em>? Definitely wasn't expecting that. Certainly not the case on my desktop.</p>

<p>I would have loved to test the performance of Metro on OSX, but unfortunately the OSX port had no benchmark tool and barely offered any graphics options to speak of.</p>

<h2 id="batmanarkhamcity">Batman: Arkham City</h2>

<p>Finally, I found the one recent game in my Steam library that had an in-game benchmark on OSX: Batman: Arkham City. I ran it on the Low and High presets in 1680×1050.</p>

<p>The Unreal 3 engine isn't as fancy as the Metro engine and the benchmarks reflect this. Discrete performance is "only" around 40% faster than integrated.</p>

<p>A few more telling benchmarks would be Far Cry 3, Crysis 2/3, Battlefield 3/4, and Max Payne 3. These represent some of the most powerful engines available on PC right now. I might add a few more measurements later on.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There you have it! A bit of benchmark geekery to shed some light on the new Macbook Pro's graphics situation. What have we learned?</p>

<ul>
<li>The Nvidia 750m is significantly better than the Intel Iris Pro 5200 in many cases, surpassing it by 25%-70% in framerate. With that said, the Iris Pro is powerful enough to run most of the same games at lower settings, which is all the more impressive considering its very low power consumption. I would frankly be surprised if the next generation of Macbook Pros even <em>had</em> a discrete graphics chip, and given the speed at which Intel is improving their graphics performance, that might be OK by me.</li>
<li>Bootcamp performs a whole lot better than Parallels, generally by 50%-60%. Performance is also a lot smoother. Still pretty darn impressive, considering that the VM boots up in about 5 seconds and hangs out in your dock while Bootcamp requires closing all your applications and rebooting. For the vast majority of Windows applications, Parallels looks like the winner. (Side note: I noticed really frustrating controller lag in Spelunky until I disabled vertical synchronization in the VM options. Unfortunately, this caused some pretty heavy tearing.)</li>
<li>I wasn't specifically testing for it since I knew the answer already, but OSX really suffers in graphics performance compared to Windows. The state of Mac ports in general is honestly a bit sad. Many of them run in a compatibility layer like Wine instead of running natively. Saves usually aren't synced between Mac and Windows. Graphics menus often leave you with far fewer choices, going so far as a single-axis slider for Metro. Crashes and other bizzare problems frequently show up. Unless you're playing games by Valve or Blizzard, you'll be better off running in Bootcamp or Parallels. (And even then, I've noticed weird mouse behavior, network errors, and outright crashes in the Mac port of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!)</li>
<li>In terms of hardware, Macs haven't traditionally been known for their gaming prowess, but all that's changed. If I can run Metro, I can call this a gaming machine. End of story.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other subtle advantages and disadvantages that the discrete graphics chip brings to the table. I might as well mention them here.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pro:</strong> OpenCL can allegedly use both the integrated and discrete chips simultaneously. Apple seems to be pushing for OpenCL these days, so we may see significant performance gains in this area as high performance apps catch up. Hopefully, the new Mac Pro will be a cataclyst for this.</li>
<li><strong>Con:</strong> Discrete graphics really eat through your battery life. While most applications don't automatically switch to discrete graphics, some do and won't switch back until you close them. As far as I know, the only easy way to tell which chip is currently active is to use <a href="http://gfx.io">gfxCardStatus</a>. You can also use this tool to force OSX into integrated graphics mode, unless you're hooked up to an external monitor. However, there's no guarantee that this workaround will keep working with future OS updates!</li>
<li><strong>Con:</strong> In Bootcamp, you can't switch to integrated graphics. This means that if you run your top-of-the-line Macbook in Windows, you'll have poor battery life. Not so if you buy a Macbook without discrete graphics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, a quick note on the day-to-day performance of this machine. Holy matchsticks, is it fast! I didn't realize it was even <em>possible</em> to boot up a VM in 5 seconds, let alone run a game like Metro on it. On my previous machine, a mid-range Core2Duo with 8GB RAM, booting up the VM was an ordeal, and often left one OS or the other in an unusable state. Here, it's as smooth as opening any other app. In terms of game performance, I'm super impressed by how well most of my favorite games run, even compared to my desktop. Lightroom is blazing fast when browsing and developing, though full-size previews for my 8MP photos take a second each to generate. And, of course, the Retina display is stunningly beautiful, though it does seem a bit darker than the screen on my previous laptop. Might just be a trick of the eye.</p>

<p>(One minor Bootcamp issue: Windows 7 doesn't deal with DPI scaling very well, so running at the native 2880×1800 with 200% DPI looks kinda bad. Unfortunately, the halved 1440×900 isn't a standard resolution according to the Nvidia driver and looks a bit blurry. Since anything other than 2880×1800 was going to be blurry anyways, I've resorted to running in 1680×1050. Interestingly, since the Windows VM uses Parallels' own graphics driver, it does not have this problem at 1440×900.)</p>

<p>I realize this is one of the most expensive machines on the market, but if you want something that can develop OSX/iOS apps <em>and</em> run Windows <em>and</em> play all your games <em>and</em> be compact enough to travel with for long periods of time <em>and</em> have enough screen estate to do serious work... [deep breath]... <em>and</em> have a beautiful and sturdy design that will last you many years, this laptop truly has no equals. Price is a tough pill to swallow, though.</p>

<p>Hello! I don't know what happened. Sorry. I think I fell asleep for half a year. OK, I really need to put up the rest of my photos from my US trip. But before that...</p>

<p>I'm in Barcelona! And instead of flying, I took a ship.</p>

<p>I was originally thinking of crossing the Atlantic on a freighter, but <a href="http://tynan.com/cruisework">an article by a globetrotting programmer</a> pointed me to a somewhat more comfortable option: cruise ships. Wait, wait — before you think "how posh", hear me out! As it turns out, during certain times of year, the big cruise lines ferry some of their ships across the Atlantic to prepare for their summer Mediterranean cruises. Since these sailings only go one way and happen during typically non-vacation times of the year, they are often very cheap. What's more, the article pointed to these cruises as a fantastic way to get programming work done. Sure, internet is a no-go, but if you can get past that, you basically have an idyllic floating office (food service and hot tub included!) for a work week or two. Given my needs, it was a no-brainer.</p>

<p>The author of the article had a website called <a href="http://cruisesheet.com/">CruiseSheet</a> to help find these sorts of cruises. This is where I started my research.</p>

<h2 id="cruisetips">Cruise Tips</h2>

<h3 id="transatlanticcruisescanberidiculouslycheapatcertaintimesofyear">Transatlantic cruises can be ridiculously cheap at certain times of year.</h3>

<p>In March, April, and May of this year, I've seen a good number of 2 week cruises going for $300 per person for a 2 person inside cabin. Windowed cabins are usually only $50-$100 more per person. Remember what I said about freight ships? Turns out, they are usually about 3x as expensive, for reasons completely alien to me. However... </p>

<h3 id="thelistpriceofacruiseisntreallyitsfinalprice">The list price of a cruise isn't really its final price.</h3>

<p>...you also have to factor in port taxes and government fees (usually $100-$200). There's also gratuities, which usually default around $12-$13 per day. These are deducted automatically, but you're free to change them by talking to Guest Services. (Don't cheap out on this.) Fortunately, you can pay them off with onboard credit. Don't worry: food is included in the price!</p>

<h3 id="forgettingagooddealtravelagentsdontreallybringmuchtothetable">For getting a good deal, travel agents don't really bring much to the table.</h3>

<p>For the most part, travel agents offer the same exact price as the cruise websites, with a few rare exceptions. If you'd like to explore your options, <a href="http://www.cruisecompete.com">CruiseCompete</a> allows you to submit a request for quotes from travel agents. They end up mostly being the same; I think I only saw one that offered me a lower price than retail, and I had to buy their travel insurance to get it. One thing travel agents <em>can</em> offer you is a bit of onboard credit, but it's usually not much for cheap cruises like the ones I'm describing. I've only seen $50 at most in my price range.</p>

<h3 id="butifyouflexyourcapitalistmusclesyoucansaveafewhundredbucks">But if you flex your capitalist muscles, you can save a few hundred bucks!</h3>

<p>Most cruise lines have something called a "shareholder benefit", where if you own a small amount of their stock (usually 100 units, or about $6000 total), you can get $200-$250 onboard credit for these long cruises. Yes, it's a lot of cash to toy with — but if you have the means to do it, all you have to do is buy the stock, e-mail them a statement, and sell it off when it gets a bit higher. You'll end up with free onboard credit and quite possibly a bit more money in the bank to boot.</p>

<p>I just had to go and try this! As soon as I bought the stock on my Vanguard account (4 days processing), I sent Royal my statement. They got back to me in a week telling me that the credit would show up in my onboard account by the second day (which it did). The credit went on to cover the entirety of my gratuity ($12 per day by default), $50 of internet (about 10 minutes per day — more on that in another article), and part of a haircut. On the downside... I got unlucky and managed to buy the stock at its peak. A week after I bought it, I was down $400. Currently, I'm only down about $140, which means that I'm actually ahead by $110 if you factor in the onboard credit. Still, I think I'll wait until the stock surpasses the price I bought it at, which it probably will, given that the trendline has been pretty much linear for the past year. As with any transaction involving the stock market, YES, it's a gamble, and YES, there are potentially massive risks involved — no question about it. But for $250 for free... maybe worth it.</p>

<p>(Do note that the shareholder benefit might not be compatible with other discounts and onboard credit offers, though some people have suggested that travel agent credit doesn't count. I don't know!)</p>

<h3 id="singlesupplementsucks">Single supplement sucks.</h3>

<p>If you're travelling by yourself, you'll in all likelihood have to pay 2x the price. Pro: you have the entire room to yourself. Con: a burning hole in your pocket. Note that Norwegian Cruise Lines has rooms on some of their ships designed specifically for singles, allowing you to waive the single supplement. The one I saw cost $650 and was a swanky-looking inside suite.</p>

<h3 id="cruisepricescanchangedrasticallyonanalmostdailybasis">Cruise prices can change drastically on an almost daily basis.</h3>

<p>This was a bit surprising to me. When I saw the price of an oceanview room on a cruise I was considering drop nearly <em>$300</em>, to below the price of an inside cabin, and then back in a single day, I figured it was some sort of fluke. But no: if you look at the price graphs for the cheaper rooms on a price tracking site like <a href="http://www.cruisefish.net/">CruiseFish</a>, you'll probably see weird spikes a few times every month, sometimes to absurd lows. It sometimes pays to be patient, unless...</p>

<h3 id="theperfecttimetobuy">The perfect time to buy?</h3>

<p>...you wake up one day to find everything sold out! I spent just a little too long deciding on my cruise, and I refreshed one morning to suddenly find that the prices for the cruise I was favoring spiked by almost $500 overnight. A quick call revealed that the cheap oceanview cabins had all sold out. I asked about a different cruise, and it turned out that there was only a single room available at the good price. I quickly nabbed it. Turns out that even for these lesser-sailed routes, you'll start seeing the cheap rooms sell out about a month in advance, and probably a bit earlier than that. (Note that if prices drop within 48 hours, most cruise lines have a price guarantee that you can redeem for onboard credit. Be vigilant after you buy!)</p>

<h2 id="somedata">Some Data</h2>

<p>I was interested in the long-term behavior of these prices, so I picked 5 cruises out of the ones I was considering and tracked their cheapest inside and outside cabin prices over the course of about a month. Here are the results, adjusted for the single supplement. ($0 means sold out.)</p>

<p>As you can see, pricing behavior varied wildly between the three companies. Norwegian barely changed their prices. Celebrity changed their prices occasionally. Royal's indoor cabin prices remained mostly stable, but their outdoor cabins fluctated wildly and unpredictably, almost to the very last day. (And even with their indoor cabins, you could save a hundred bucks just by waiting a day.) As we got closer to the sailing date, prices rose all around. Cabins were selling out on a whim, then coming back a few days later.</p>

<p>Based on my findings, for the category of cheap transatlantic cruises out of the US, I think 2 months ahead of time is a good time to buy, with 1 month being the point at which things start selling out rapidly.</p>

<h2 id="inconclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>After a month of nail biting and frantic refreshing, I decided on a 16-day Royal Caribbean cruise from New Orleans to Barcelona. My original intent was to land in London, but the 16-day was cheap enough that if I really wanted to get to England straight away, I could simply take the train for close to the price difference. The pre-gratuity price for the voyage was $1100 for a windowed room. (Non-windowed was $200 cheaper, but basically my entire family forced me to take the windowed room by helping pay the difference.) Going with a friend would have cost $550 per person, but sadly, no friends were available. At the time I booked the ship, a flight would have cost me about $600. Transport pricing is unfortunately pretty obtuse, and there are a lot of factors to consider. I've heard, for example, that round-trip plane tickets tend to be cheaper than one-way, and that there's the occasional rare deal where you can fly into a European country for only $200-$300. But all in all, even without factoring in the benefit of transportation, I think the cruise was a fantastic deal. Depending on how you look at it, I got to spend $50-$80 per day total for a great office, fantastic food, and the rare experiencing of crossing the ocean (the ocean!!) by sea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>So how's programming on a cruise ship, anyway?</p>

<p>First of all, you can't count on the internet out at sea. That's not to say it's unusable: I saw speeds as high as 15Mbit/sec down, though they usually hovered around 1Mbit/sec or less. (Ping was atrocious, of course.) However, at almost a dollar per minute during regular hours, it was hard to justify. One deal that my particular cruise offered was half-price internet from 11pm to 5am, giving me a rate of $0.37/minute. (This was actually better than most of the package deals and allowed me pay à la carte.) Having mentally allotted $50 for internet use, this meant that I could only use about 10 minutes per day, or 20 if I went once every 2 days. For the most part, I spent these periods rapidly opening a bunch of tabs to Gmail, Feedbin, and Hacker News, loading any new articles I needed since the last internet checkpoint, disconnecting to write any replies, and reconnecting one final time to send them out. It was basic, but it kept me content. (All logging in and logging out was done through an atrocious web interface, while the charges could be verified through an equally despicable account navigator on the cabin television.)</p>

<p>Offline programming might sound daunting (the old-timers are laughing at me now), but it's really not so bad. No, not because you're supposed to be good enough to program without an online reference. It's because you can cheat and download the <a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">entire StackExchange data dump</a> for only 20GB of your hard drive space (circa January 2014)! Even more spoilingly, a wonderful developer named Samuel Lai has created a local web app called <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/3610/stackdump-an-offline-browser-for-stackexchange-sites">stackdump</a> that lets you browse and search this entire archive using a beautifully-designed interface that almost rivals StackExchange itself. (Seriously, I could see myself paying $100 for this product.) Stackdump copies the XML data to a local database, so it requires a good chunk of extra space: I have it showing about 20GB for StackOverflow alone. Furthermore, the initial copy takes about 7-8 hours on a top-of-the-line machine, and could potentially take much longer on a slower one. If you only figure this out in the middle of your trip, you might be in for a bad time. My advice is to clear up 50-100GB of your hard drive space and run the script locally (read: not on an external drive), since you'll be able to suspend and resume your machine without interrupting the indexing. Fortunately, after the initial hump, it's all smooth sailing! (So to speak.)</p>

<p>In addition to this little ace up my sleeve, I downloaded local copies of the documentation for all the platforms, libraries, and frameworks I intended to use during my trip. (These included iOS and OSX, Python, and Cocos2d.) Xcode's local documentation browser was my most used resource by far, with stackdump serving as a secondary reference for some of my more esoteric questions.</p>

<p>One cache that I would have benefitted from having, but unfortunately forgot to bring, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download">Wikipedia data dump</a>. It didn't really cross my mind when I was preparing for my trip, but Wikipedia has some great high-level overviews of CS concepts and programming languages/features. The total compressed size is about 40GB: not bad for a first-order approximation of the sum total of human knowledge!</p>

<p>Before leaving, I made sure to test all my tools in offline mode, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Turns out it was a good hunch: I almost left without renewing my Apple developer certificate, which would have prevented me from testing on my device!</p>

<p>Having prepared ahead of time, I found working on the boat to be a wonderful experience. The ship offered many comfortable and scenic places to set up. I preferred sitting outside in the aft café during the day and in my cabin at night. My room had a wide, comfortable desk with plenty of power outlets, and the indirect sunlight from the porthole made the space feel cozy and relaxing. Despite my initial fears, I found myself barely missing the internet at all.</p>

<p>Programming is unfortunately an activity that tends to isolate us in quiet, poorly-lit spaces, so it was wonderful to work out in the open ocean air for a change! Now that I'm back on land, I may have to find some work-friendly parks to recreate that experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>There was a great article a year ago which described the working spaces of great writers, business men, world leaders. Fascinating how differently everyone worked but the conclusion the artcile came to was that it didn't really seem to matter whether you were working in a windowless bunker or the balcony of a Swiss chateau, it didn't even seem to matter that you were particularly comfortable. What mattered was that you could concentrate.</p>

<p>Think I might have to try a cruise for my next in depth coding sabbatical, I'll definitely refer to this article so I have all my resources ready for offline access. Thanks for sharing.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Airbnb Tip Fest 2000</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2014/5/31/airbnb-tip-fest-2000</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/538a7186e4b0cfc7f0c5a808/1401581964937//img.jpg" alt="A quiet day on the fifth floor of Sants, Barcelona."/> A quiet day on the fifth floor of Sants, Barcelona.[/caption] 
  

<p>I've come to the conclusion that if you're doing the work-travel thing, you always need to have a reliable, quiet place nearby to retreat to. Most hostels just don't offer that level of privacy, while hotels are too expensive. Coworking spaces would be great, except they cost an extra $10-$30 per day. (Except the gratis <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a> in New York, but there's no privacy there to speak of.)</p>

<p>Aside from finding rooms to rent or sublet (which can be tricky in a foreign country), the best solution I've been able to find so far is <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/c/ababoulevitch">Airbnb</a>. (Sign up with my referral link to earn us both credit, I think!) Per day, Airbnb listings tend to be roughly on par with hostels in terms of price; per month, they're more expensive than the local rental rate, but not astronomically.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true">1</sup> And for the extra cost, you get your own room (often with a window and desk), one or more locals to chat with, a fantastic communication and creditibility channel, and a neat little paper trail of all the places you've been to. Plus, you get to experience life in a foregin city as a local! If you've ever been to Europe, tell me you've never walked down the twisted cobblestone streets and wondered what life was like in those arborial, patchwork buildings...</p>

<p>Here are a few tips for finding great Airbnb rentals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the owner's profile first and foremost. Do they have reviews and references? Do they have photos of themselves out in the real world? Do they sound like an actual human being in their writing? Does their listing have personality?<sup data-preserve-html-node="true">2</sup></li>
<li>This applies to you as well! The owner can reject your request for any reason, so get some good photos, write up a friendly description, and add as many verifications as possible.</li>
<li>Does the owner have several places listed in different parts of the city? (That is, are they "playing landlord"?) Look for people renting out rooms in the same house they're living in. One, this tends to be more legal, and two, you can be sure that people who rent where they live care a whole lot more about the state of their accommodations.</li>
<li>Are some of the listing photos labeled with "Airbnb.com Verified Photo"? Listings that have these photos have been visited by an official Airbnb photographer, which gives them a bit more credibility. Stay away from listings with lots of touristy photos: you want as many good photos of the interior as possible.</li>
<li>Does the listing have House Rules? When I see House Rules, I feel more confident that I'm going to be living in an actual house with real people instead of some derelict tourist pad.</li>
<li>Are there going to be other Airbnb guests in the house? Remember: Airbnb rentals usually don't have safes, so you have to trust the people you're staying with. On your end, hosts have a paper trail; other guests do not. (On the other hand, I had a very enjoyable time with two fellow Airbnb guests during my first booking. I imagine that, on average, they're a more interesting breed of traveller than hostel dwellers, at least for mid-twenties folks such as myself!)</li>
<li>Some Airbnb listings are actually hostel listings, which becomes clear when you see a bunch of bunk beds in the photos. I highly recommend booking through an actual hostel site (<a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/">HostelWorld</a>, <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/">HostelBookers</a>) if you want to go that route. It's not really what Airbnb is for.</li>
<li>Instead of doing meticulous research and trying to reserve the one place you like, get a list of 2-10 places you think might work for you and send a message to each of the hosts via the "Contact Me" button. Ask them a few simple questions. Is the room available during this time? Do you get your own key? The reason you want to do this is that more often than not, even when you're just reaching out to to get some information, the hosts will pre-approve you for a short period of time to expedite the booking process. This means that after everyone responds to you, you'll get your pick of several places that are a guaranteed approval. (Warning: multiple guests can be pre-approved at once, so if you get pre-approaved for a listing you like, don't dawdle!) What's more, the calendars for many listings are hopelessly out of date: even when they're marked green, there's a good chance they'll be unavailable simply because the host never bothered to update their calendar.</li>
<li>Airbnb has the ability to offer different pricing for weekly and monthly rentals, and monthly prices in particular can be <em>drastically</em> cheaper than daily rates. If you're traveling for a while, try moving the date slider forward a bit. Additionally, even when it looks like a city is all booked out, checking for monthly rentals might yield a few more results since those places tend to be more expensive on a daily basis. (Note that even if a place is available for monthly rental, it's by no means assured that the host will go for it. It's best to contact them and ask if the dates are available.)</li>
<li>Airbnb offers a currency conversion option by default. <em>Don't use this</em>. If your credit card currency differs from the local currency, you'll be hit with a 3% surcharge. On the payment screen, there's a drop-down menu for your country right above the credit card picker. Select the country that you're currently in and make sure the pricing caption in the lower-right corner doesn't say anything about currency conversion or surcharges. (I don't think you can do this in the mobile app.)</li>
<li>Although this happens rarely, hosts can cancel a reservation some days in advance. Make sure you're aware of your other options if this happens.</li>
<li>It's not a huge issue, but it's worth Googling to see if the city you're travelling to has a problem with Airbnb rentals. For example, New York (until recently?) has been pretty strict about it. You don't want to risk getting evicted because the owner never bothered to read up on the local laws!</li>
<li>Finally, be sure to leave reviews! Reviews are Airbnb's capital. It's what makes the whole thing tick. Unfortunately, judging by the number of reservations compared to the number of reviews for the average listing, it sure seems that most people don't bother. If you do it, not only will you help out your host in a big way, but you'll make it more likely for the host to leave a review for you as well.</li>
</ul>

<hr data-preserve-html-node="true">

<p><small data-preserve-html-node="true"></p>

<ol>
<li>Airbnb has got me looking at rental prices in the places I'm travelling to. (<a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/">Numbeo</a> is a good site for this, though I can't speak to its accuracy.) Unfortunately, compared to local prices, daily Airbnb prices are still significantly pricier than rent. For example, in Barcelona, a cheap-ish room in a shared house can go for $35 a day, whereas if you're paying rent, you can get a flat all to yourself close to the center of town for just $30 a day, or $13 a day with roomates. (Plus utilities, internet, etc.)</li>
<li>AKA, "how not to get scammed on Craigslist or eBay 101". Asking for hosts to show a little personality might seem a little... entitled?, but it's the most sure-fire way to tell the difference between a genuine person and someone out for a quick buck. I've always adhered to this principle when buying or selling on eBay and Craigslist and never had a problem.</li>
</ol>

      <title>State of the Union</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2015/1/31/state-of-the-union</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3f330e4b062dc340fa8fd/51b3f3e9e4b01e3c41a50a05/54cda54ee4b0c684830e885a/1422763344252//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>I'm sure bad at this blogging thing. Since I first set out in — technically, July 2013, but let's say August — I've only gotten <em>one week</em> into my journey before hanging up. I'd like to see if I can try again, perhaps this time with a little more success.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm writing this from Dublin, Ireland. In the interim, since my last entry from an actual city, I've visited Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans, Austin, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Paris, London, Cornwall, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Prague, Berlin, Vienna, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Split, Bologna, Modena, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Turin — plus a number of smaller towns along the way. That's more than a dozen different countries over the course of the past two years. To the person first setting out on this trip — the person who expected to arrive in London and cautiously venture to other countries only on rare occasion — this list would have been unimaginable. I was nervous. I'd never been alone in a place where the primary language wasn't English. I wasn't sure about the logistics. I didn't even know if I'd be able to tinker with my projects in peace.</p>

<p>But it's all worked out. I've cracked the code. With some trial and error, I've figured out how to live affordably and comfortably in different cities around the world. I've gotten a lot more bold about venturing to places where I have to resort to broken apologetic phrases in a new language. I've discovered many breathtaking sights, incredible architectural wonders, and fascinating local tastes. I've pared my belongings down to a bare minimum appropriate for most climates. I've worked in many lovely cafés, bars, and apartments. I feel like I understand so much more about the world than when I started.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've also had to face certain facets of myself head-on, with uncertain results. I've learned that my impression of different cities around the world was heavily painted by my childhood imagination. The places I'd hoped would bring my soul some peace —&nbsp;a magical sort of quality that I faintly recall in cities like London, Barcelona, and Rome from when I was little — were found to be fairly ordinary in contrast. I've found it disheartening to overwrite so much impressionistic imagery in my head with reality — because I know those feelings will never be back. I've learned that no matter how lonely I might get at times, there is still no part of me that will seek out others for company. I've learned that I can swallow up entire months at a time and wake up on the other end a good chunk older, but with nothing to show for it. All the attributes I hated about myself as a young teen are still there, entrenched, and at this point as much a part of my personality as anything else. I've learned that there are parts of me that I constantly have to fight, lest I end up old, unfulfilled, and alone. </p>

<p>I've also learned that time moves quickly, and that it's easy to get stuck in a simple routine. I've developed a great, burning fear that prods me almost every waking minute. The fear of aging. The fear of death. The fear of it "being too late". Every day, I count the fractions of my age. 26 point 0. Point 25. Point 3, repeating. Every day that I'm not doing something productive — which is most days, to be honest — I feel like I'm actively destroying my potential. Other dates have been creeping into my head, too. How old is too old to live in a house with other people? How old is too old to get married? To have kids, if I decide to have them? To have a nice house, friendly neighbors, warm dinner parties? When I was in college, I half-jokingly feared that my study habits — put it off, put it off, then half-ass it on the last day — would translate in broader strokes to the rest of my life. But now I see that this was no joke. This is exactly what happens when you let a negative aspect of your personality fester for years and years.</p>

<p>But these dark thoughts are not a reflection on travel. My journey has neither been a negative experience nor an entirely positive one. I see it as just another page in the book of my life: many new and interesting inputs from the environment feeding into the black box of my mind, allowing me to discover new truths about the world and myself.</p>

<p>So that's what's going on in my head on this day, January the 31st, 2015, in the city of Dublin. And now, let's step back into the past, to Vancouver, as it was during the <a href="http://beta-blog.archagon.net/2015/02/01/vancouver/">last few weeks of August of 2013</a> ...</p>

<p>(Technical note: from this point on, I will be posting all my blog entries on the <a href="http://beta-blog.archagon.net">beta-blog</a> subdomain of my website. They will be linked from the main site, but I highly suggest reading on beta-blog instead. Eventually, the main site — hosted on Squarespace — will be removed, and the beta-blog page — hosted on Github Pages using a static site generator — will replace it. I will backport all the existing entries before I do that, and all the links should still hopefully work.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Credit/Debit for Travel 101</title>
      <link>/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/10/18/creditdebit-for-travel-101</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let's say you want to travel. Maybe for a while. Maybe in a bunch of different countries. You know you only have a limited supply of money, and you don't want the credit card companies to nab a large chunk of it. What do you do?</p><div class="sqs-image sqs-empty"><div class="sqs-image-content"></div></div><h1>Debit</h1>

<p>First, your debit card. Most debit cards only allow free withdrawals from their issuing bank, with all other ATMs charging as much as $3 per transaction. On top of that, if you take out money at a foreign ATM, there's usually going to be an inflated exchange fee. But! There's a wonderful, magical card that not only exchanges your currency at the market rate, but refunds <i>all</i> ATM fees. That card is the Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account debit card, almost unequivocally recommended by travellers everywhere. All you have to do to get one is <a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account">sign up for a free account on Schwab's website</a>. You get a checking account and a brokerage account from the deal, but you don't have to use the latter if you don't want to. There are no annual fees; your refunds show up in your checking account at the end of each month. (Schwab says that you can contact them for a manual refund if they don't catch an ATM transaction, but that hasn't happened to me yet.) Even better, Schwab has one of the best banking websites I've ever seen, and they even allow interbank ACH transfers<a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a><span id="credit_debit_101_footnote_1_return" /> with no additional fees.</p>

<p>After several months of using my Schwab card across the US and Canada, it has become one of the most invaluable tools in my arsenal. When you're low on cash, it's incredibly liberating to be able to use any ratty ATM without having to worry about additional charges. Better yet, my exchange rate in Canada was always a fair $19 USD to $20 CAD, which is almost exactly the rate given by Google. I don't know what I'd do without this card!</p><div class="sqs-image sqs-empty"><div class="sqs-image-content"></div></div><h1>Credit</h1>

<p>Next, you should probably get a credit card or two. This one's a little more complicated.</p>

<p>For purchases abroad, credit cards are among the best options available. Most cards only have a 3% foreign transaction fee (1% from VISA, plus whatever the bank wants to charge), compared to 10% or more with more traditional methods like traveller's checks. There are even a few credit cards available with 0% fees. (From what I understand, 0% means that the bank actually pays VISA for letting you use their card!) This is the first feature you be looking at, since even 3% overhead could mean hundreds of dollars wasted down the line, depending on how long you'll be travelling for.</p>

<p>The second important feature is EMV (chip) functionality. In contrast to the magnetic stripe cards that are prevalent in the US, many countries in Europe have switched to chipped cards as an added measure of security. Although most businesses outside the US will still gladly swipe your card, it's becoming less and less of a guarantee. In addition, many unmanned vending machiens and kiosks in Europe are only able to accept chipped cards — not even cash! Even if you decide to go with a magnetic stripe card as your primary card, you'll probably want to have a chipped card as a backup.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of chipped cards: chip-and-pin and chip-and-signature. Out of the two, chip-and-pin cards are by far the most common abroad. To use one, you stick it into a slot on the bottom of the credit card terminal, enter your PIN, and hit enter. Chip-and-signature cards go in the same slot, but they don't have a PIN; instead, they make the machine print out a receipt for you to sign, just like with an ordinary swipe card. There are notable downsides to going with chip-and-signature over chip-and-pin: many automated kiosks in Europe only accept chip-and-pin cards, and merchants aren't used to dealing with the printed receipt from chip-and-signature transactions. Nonetheless, having a chip-and-signature card is still better than having no chipped card at all.</p>

<p>As a recent data point, chipped cards have become standard even up in Canada. When I visited last month, I barely ever saw anyone swipe their card.<a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a><span id="credit_debit_101_footnote_2_return" /> The card I used was chip-and-signature, and practically every merchant I met did a double-take when the second receipt printed out. I eventually resorted to asking ahead of time whether my signature was needed, since inevitably the merchat would run after me with a pen if I didn't. (And even when I asked, some of them <i>still</i> said "no" before being surprised by the sudden appareance of the second receipt!)</p>

<p>There is a growing number of EMV cards available in the US. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ani-u3tGk5hedGRvcE1ELVg5UmlGZk01SHZvTUMxdUE#gid=0">Here's a spreadsheet with a wealth of information about pretty much every single one</a>, courtesy of the FlyerTalk forums.</p>

<p>As you can see, chip-and-pin cards are still quite rare, but it's not too hard to get one. There are currently three credit unions in the US that offer chip-and-pin functionality and 0% fees: Andrews, State Department, and PenFed. Their cards are all very similar. For example, they all simultaneously have chip-and-pin <i>and</i> chip-and-signature technolgoy, defaulting to signature; meaning, they'll only resort to asking for your PIN if they have no choice, such as at an unmanned kiosk. You can join Andrews and State Department once you've joined the American Consumer Council, which is free and easy to do online. For PenFed, you can apparently make a donation to join, but I haven't investigated.</p>

<p>There are two more features in a credit card that are very useful for a traveler: VISA Signature, and rewards programs. With a VISA Signature card, you get a wide variety of complementary services, including automatic extended warranties, lost luggage coverage, rental auto insurance, concierge service, and more. Credit card rewards programs give you back a percentage of your purchases, usually 1%—3% in either cash-back or proprietary points. Some points can only be exchanged for specific things (Hilton stays) while others are more generic and can be used on Amazon or exchanged for gift cards. Many credit cards also offer hefty signup bonuses that can reach $300 or more. If you have a good credit rating and are responsible with your payments, that's basically free money!<a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a><span id="credit_debit_101_footnote_3_return" /></p>

<p>If you're thinking of getting a chip-and-pin card, the Andrews Federal Credit Union GlobeTrek VISA is a good option. It's one of the oldest chip-and-pin cards in the US, and as such, has been vetted by a large number of international travellers. Unfortunately, Andrews' banking website still leaves much to be desired, and the application process was a bit arduous when I applied.<a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a><span id="credit_debit_101_footnote_4_return" /> There are also a few quirks with day-to-day usage of this card, though I don't know if it's an issue with Andrews in particular or if all credit unions have similar problems.<a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a><span id="credit_debit_101_footnote_5_return" /> With that said, they recently updated their website, and I imagine they have a lot of pressure to improve as one of the most popular chip-and-pin options for travellers.</p>

<p>For your everyday spending credit card, you might want to take a look at the Citibank ThankYou Premier or the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Both have 0% foreign transaction fees, though they do charge an annual fee that's waived for the first year. Both have pretty good signup rewards: ~$200 for Citi and ~$350 for Chase. Both cards are VISA Signature cards, and both offer chip-and-signature support. If you don't want to bother with the annual fee, the CapitalOne Cash Rewards is a great card with no fees, VISA Signature, and a [] bonus. You can find updated lists of no-fee cards, along with reviews, at websites like [] and [].</p>

  <p>For redundancy, it might be a good idea to pack at least two debit and two credit cards. Some ATM machines have been known to eat debit cards in case of an error, and credit card companies are notorious for cutting you off at even the slightest hint of fraud. You don't want to get stuck without any money halfway across the world!</p><div class="sqs-image sqs-empty"><div class="sqs-image-content"></div></div><p>Conclusion: debt might be bad and banks might be crooked, but you would be wise to use the financial resources available to you.</p><hr /><ol class="footnotes">
<li id="credit_debit_101_footnote_1">There are several ways of transfering money between banks in the US: ACH transfers, wire transfers, and checks. Both ACH transfers and wire transfers are elctronic. ACH transfers take a few days to clear, while wire transfers are instantaneous. On the downside, pretty much every bank charges about $20 per wire transfer. <a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_1_return">↩</a></li>

<li id="credit_debit_101_footnote_2">For the record, it's no crime to sign up for a credit card for the reward and then cancel once your free year is up. In fact, there are communities out there that "churn" thorugh large numbers of credit cards every year in order to maximize the amount of points they get! Despite what you may think, this is unlikely to lower your credit score, and in fact will probably raise it in the long run. The only catch is that you have to pay off your bills every month, never go into debt, and only go on a churning spree once every few months. <a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_2_return">↩</a></li>

<li id="credit_debit_101_footnote_3">Many of these terminals were also battery-powered and wireless, meaning that waiters usually brought them to your table instead of whisking your card away. There were even buttons to automatically add the tip. Really neat stuff! <a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_3_return">↩</a></li>

<li id="credit_debit_101_footnote_4">Here's how the application process went down:

<ol>
<li>I applied for a free membership at the <a href="http://www.americanconsumercouncil.org/">American Consumer Council</a> and got a membership number by e-mail right away.</li>
<li>I went to the <a href="https://www.andrewsfcu.org/credit_cards_and_loans/credit_cards/globetrek_rewards.html">credit card application site</a> and filled out the online form. They had a checkmark for whether you already had a checking/savings account at Andrews, so I assumed they would create one for me automatically. Oops.</li>
<li>A day or two later, Andrews called me to confirm my application and asked me to send over some pay stubs.</li>
<li>A few days later, I called to check on the status of my credit card application. It turns out I was approved for a credit line, but couldn't get the card yet because I didn't have a bank account at Andrews. Apparently, their bank account and credit card departments were separate.</li>
<li>So I filled out the <a href="https://www.andrewsfcu.org/checking_and_savings.html">bank account online application</a> and provided them with my ACC membership number. (I highly recommend doing this step first.)</li>
<li>Soon afterwards, Andrews' credit card department called me and let me know that they were sending me some electronic documents to sign.</li>
<li>About a week later, I got my debit and GlobeTrek VISA cards in the mail, along with two PIN numbers. Although it didn't say so on the papers, one PIN was for my debit card and the other was for use with the chip-and-pin feature of my credit card. I had to try each pin with my debit card at a co-op ATM in order to figure out which was which.</li>
<li>I then had to mail a physical copy of my membership application along with a signature card (provided as a PDF during the application process) to Andrews.</li>
<li>Finally, in order to allow phone support to help me in case I got stuck somewhere, I had to send in a <a href="https://www.andrewsfcu.org/forms.html">security password notification form</a> to set up my security phrase.</li>
</ol>

<li id="credit_debit_101_footnote_5">Among the problems: <ul>
<li>Paying off your credit card is a bit of a mysterious process. There are apparently two places you can do this: your <a href="https://www.andrewsfcu.org/">Andrews SmartConnect account</a>, and a separate service called <a href="https://www.epscu.com/servlet/2977/raAppHtml?ServicePageName=com.invisiondev.JServer.xml.xmlProcess&amp;RQID=LOGINMFA&amp;ORGID=2977">VISA Online</a>. If you go to the Andrews website, there's a stand-alone account called "VISA" your Andrews , along with your checking and savings accounts, there's also a stand-alone account called "VISA". This account looks like your other accounts, but it can only accept transfers into it, not out. Once you've put your money in, it stays there until your credit card statement is due, at which point it's whisked away to pay off the balance. Weird.</li>
<li>Andrews has at least two different phone numbers and addresses for each department. I imagine this has to do with them contracting out some of their services. Nonetheless, it makes it hard to tell who to call and where to send stuff.</li>
<li>Credit union co-op ATMs aren't very reliable or user-friendly. Oftentimes, they'll get to the deposit/withdrawal screen, but then fail mysteriously when you try to do something. They'll do this <strong>even if you enter the wrong PIN</strong>. It's also a pain to deposit cash into your account. You can't do it via most ATMs (the one exception is [], which only accepts checks), so you have to use physical co-op branches.</li>
</ul> <a href="#credit_debit_101_footnote_5_return">↩</a></li>]]></content:encoded>
