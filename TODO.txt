TODO

designated images
    icons
banners for archive page
rerouting list
styling â€” headers, main header

iterate generated markdown
    find first header
    find first image
    replace image with appropriate css

what we want: a plugin that can access the post html right after rendering, but before the post
is used anywhere else (allows us to process based on rendered output)


captions
get sample posts from blog
reflow archive
implicit title
