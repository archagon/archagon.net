<p>My late-2013 15” MacBook Pro’s discrete GPU — an NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M — was pretty good for gaming during the first year of its life.  But around the time that the new generation of consoles dropped, AAA games on the PC started becoming unplayable, even at postage-stamp resolutions with the lowest possible settings. I lived on a strict diet of indie games from 2015 to 2016 — thank goodness for well-tuned titles like Overwatch and The Witness! — but the itch to try games like the new Mirror’s Edge and Deus Ex became too great. Initially, I thought it might be time to switch out my MacBook for the upcoming 2016 model, but the winter reveal wasn’t particularly tempting: CPU performance was about the same as mine and the GPU was — at best — 3 times as powerful. (Still need to see the benchmarks on that — educated guess.) Worth it for a few hundred bucks, but $2000? No way!</p>

<p>Building a gaming PC wasn’t an option due to my mobile lifestyle, and in any case the kind of CPU I could buy for cheap would be comically underpowered compared to the i7 4850HQ I already had in front of me. So I started looking into the scary world of external Thunderbolt GPUs, colloquially known as eGPU. Modern Thunderbolt 3 (allegedly) supports external GPUs in an official capacity, but older Thunderbolt 2 can get the job done as well, even though it’s unsanctioned by Intel. I’m usually reluctant to pursue these sorts of under-the-radar hobbyist projects, but there was enough prior art to make it worth a shot!</p>

<p>I have to admit: I’m an analog kind of fellow. Much as I benefit from our growing roster of digital tools, I’m always on the lookout for software that reminds me of reality’s imperfect grit. Fake mechanical clock faces. <a href="http://fffff.at/noisy-typer-a-typewriter-for-your-laptop/">Typewriter sounds</a>. <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/apps/cathode/">Simulated CRT monitors</a>! Some might call them skeumorphic, clunky, or even fraudulent; but in a world increasingly bent on making things shiny and pristine, I enjoy having a reminder of which side of the screen is the more important one.</p>

<p>The same even applies to my work notes. No doubt, there are immense benefits to limiting your note-taking to professional software like OneNote or Google Docs, starting with obvious features like copy &amp; paste and text search that we all rely on while taking completely for granted. But whenever I undertake a major project, any spare pieces of paper lying around (including napkins, envelopes, and candy wrappers) will inevitably become conscripted as scratch paper, despite the vast universe of affordances on the digital side of the divide. As much as I’ve tried to adopt my thinking to software, the cold, hard truth of digital type just doesn’t represent my thoughts very well. On paper, my ideas becomes non-linear: sometimes visually grouped with related bits of info, sometimes crawling up the sides, sometimes accompanied by quick sketches and diagrams.</p>

        <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/status/767461318538383360">with a single tweet</a>, the note-taking app <a href="http://vesperapp.co">Vesper</a> has officially been shuttered. At its release, Vesper was <a href="https://marco.org/2013/06/06/vesper">widely promoted</a> by the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/vesper-review-collect-your-thoughts/">Apple indie developer communtiy</a> as the hot new thing to try. More than anything else, it had an excellent pedigree, with influential blogger John Gruber of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> at the helm. Many hopeful users switched to it for their primary note-taking needs, expecting that features like Mac support would arrive in short order. If any app from this circle was destined to be a breakaway hit, it was this one. And now, with barely a mention, it’s all but swept away, years after langishing with barely an update.</p>

            <h2 class="post-meta">Jun 21, 2016</h2>
        </header>

        <article class="section-content">
        <p>Blog comments are out, blog responses are in — and so I thought I’d respond to John Gruber’s recent article titled <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/headphone_jacks_are_the_new_floppy_drives">“Headphone Jacks Are the New Floppy Drives”</a>. Here’s why I think removing the headphone jack would be a bad idea at this moment in time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor wireless options and standards. I use Bluetooth headphones and I love them, but they’re a world of compromises. Audio quality is far from lossless, and not just because of the codecs: with the sound off, you are likely to hear noise and static from the radio right next to your ear. (This does not bother me, but would drive many people crazy.) Switching between devices is a pain. Pairing is a pain. You have to remember to charge them. There is unbearable latency for games and occasionally even movies. Few audiophile-level headphone makers bother with Bluetooth headphones, leaving us with just the consumer brands. They can only be as powerful as the battery-powered driver. Might Apple introduce a new wireless codec that tackles all of these pain points? Sure. But then we get:</li>
  <li>Vendor lock-in. Apple Wireless or Lighning headphones wouldn’t be compatible with much else. Not a problem for cheap earbuds, but definitely a big deal for high-quality, $400+ headphones. After years of freedom, audio would be siloed. As Gruber mentions, this is in Apple’s best interests; but among all our gadgets, headphones have always been among the most universal and independent. They are a true analog path between our disparate electronics — an intuitive and surprisingly error-free technology in a world where devices routinely refuse to talk to each other. You wouldn’t find yourself spending an hour helping your mom troubleshoot the headphone jack. This change would be a major pain point, especially when it comes to:</li>
  <li>Loss of plug-and-play. I constantly plug my headphones from my phone to my laptop and back. Bluetooth can <em>sort of</em> do this, but it always takes me about a minute with my wireless headphones. With Lightning headphones, it wouldn’t even be a possibility. (Barring Lightning-endowed Macbooks, which would be utterly bizzarre. What else would that port be used for? How would it be differentiated from USB-C?) A once-flexible workflow would be completely subverted.</li>
  <li>Needless complication. Headphones are a very simple thing: just a wire leading to drivers. Very few things can go wrong in this arrangement, as evidenced by the proven durability and versatility of headphones over the past few decades. Headphone makers have gotten really good at working with these few parameters to create truly world-class audio devices. Indeed, some of the most esteemed headphones in the low-end audiophile space (I’m thinking of Grados) are basically glued together by hand in a workshop. If we start shoving more electronics — Lightning circuitry or a DAC, most obviously — into headphones, we make this proven system far more brittle than it needs to be. Headphones will malfunction in frustrating ways. Noise will be introduced. Designs will become more bloated to accommodate the extra circuitry. Every headphone having its own DAC is like every monitor having its own video card: clearly putting technology on the wrong side of the divide.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is all this for? What do we gain in return?</p>

        <p>When Apple replaced its Google-powered maps app with a complete in-house rewrite for iOS 6, most users had little good to say about it. It was inaccurate. It lacked public transit directions. The search was paltry, as was the iconography. At best, it could be described as <em>slick</em>, with the pixellated pop-in of previous generations replaced by crisp, swiftly scaling vector lines. But this was not enough to offset the lack of functionality compared to Google’s definitive mapping solution, and so <a href="https://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/">Tim Cook apologized</a> and we all went on with our lives.</p>

        <p>This is the time of year when a lot of people are upgrading their phones. If you are, don’t chuck your old phone just yet!</p>

<p>Here’s a thing you might not know about your iPhone<sup id="fnref:WhyNotAndroid"></sup>: the GPS unit works even without a data connection. I was confused for a long time about what “assisted GPS” actually meant. My understanding was that it was impossible for an AGPS phone (which the iPhone is) to acquire a GPS signal without a data connection. Turns out it works fine — you just have to wait a bit longer for the phone to find a satellite.</p>

        </header>

        <article class="section-content">
        <p>I recently got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096VD85I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096VD85I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">high-end 15” Macbook Pro</a>. The 13” model I was using before had served me with faith and dignity over the years, but as my appetite for high-performance apps increased, the poor guy just couldn’t keep up like it used to. In the past, I would have only considered upgrading to another 13” laptop, but a lot has changed over the years. Computers have slimmed down. I’ve slimmed up. A 15” device just didn’t seem like the back-breaking monster it used to be.</p>

<p>The other big factor in my decision was graphics performance. Among all the Macbooks currently available, the high-end 15” Macbook Pro is the only one with a discrete graphics chip still inside. You get access to an integrated Intel Iris Pro 5200 for everyday use, but the OS can also switch you over to a powerful Nvidia 750m when the polygons have to fly. </p>

<p>At first, I naturally assumed that the 750m would kick the 5200’s butt; this was a separate ~40w component, after all. But as I started to dig through forum posts and benchmarks for my research, I discovered that while the Iris Pro usually lagged behind the 750m by 15%-50%, there were a few recorded instances where it matched or even surpassed the Nvidia chip! Some people blamed this on drivers, others on architecture. Were the numbers even accurate? I wanted to find out for myself.</p>

<p>There were a couple of specific questions I was looking to answer during my testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How good is the maximum graphics performance of this machine?</li>
  <li>How does the Iris Pro 5200 compare to the 750m?</li>
  <li>How does Windows 7 VM (Parallels) graphics performance compare to native Windows 7 (Bootcamp)?</li>
</ul>

<p>(OK, so I know a true sysadmin would be talking about the wonders of rsync in this post, but please bear with me. This was a Windows problem and I wanted to use the right Windows tool for the job.)</p>

<p>I recently got a <a href="http://www.synology.com/">Synology</a> NAS unit, and I needed to copy a couple of terabytes worth of data from my external NTFS drives over to the new RAID array. What to do? First of all, it might seem obvious to most of you, but I just want to make it clear: Windows file copy was simply not an option. Among other nasty things, my drives contained backed up user directories from a bunch of old Windows installs, meaning that they were riddled with broken permissions, confused symbolic links and NTFS junction points, and paths that were somehow too long for Windows to handle. Windows file copy would have choked about halfway through.</p>

<p>No, this was a job for some serious command line jujitsu. And thankfully, Windows has a built-in tool that was perfect for the job: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145(v=ws.10).aspx">robocopy</a>. Just like rsync, robocopy has dozens of incomprehensible flags that you need to spend hours studying to fully understand. Fortunately, I’ve whittled them down to an abridged summary in case you find yourself in a similar situation.</p>
