<p>One vital lesson I’ve been recently learning in regards to the pleasures of rampant materialism is that it’s incredibly important to surround yourself with objects that not only work well, but <em>feel</em> good. Quality finishes; smooth hinges; great materials and top-shelf workmanship. It’s not about pretension or an abstract desire for “good design”. Rather, the aim is to get the objects in your life to radiate just a little warmth your way by virtue of their excellence. Here’s an example of what I mean. A few months ago, I needed to buy a new paper notebook. I was all set to pick up the cheapest one at the grocery like I always do, but this time I decided to peek into a stationary store just to see if something could tempt me away from the budget option. There, I discovered a <a href="http://www.jennibick.com/products/paper-oh-notebook-yuko-ori">stunningly beautiful notebook</a> with a textured, gently undulating cover and perfect pearly pages. I immediately fell in love with it. The sticker price was a shocking $15, and while I berated myself at the time for spending so much money on basically paper, I’ve noticed over the past year that I always feel a little burst of joy whenever I leaf through its pages or run my hands over its cover. Point being, if you surround yourself with enough of these kinds of things, you’ll find yourself smiling when doing something as simple as picking up your favorite pen or putting a pot of water on the stove.</p>

        <p>On August 23rd, 2013, my Seattle friends and I boarded the Amtrak Cascades and headed up north in the direction of Vancouver. I couldn’t resist bringing along a small bag of produce and dairy that I’d been using to cook in the hostels, even though it added a few pounds of heft to my already-painful load.

<p>I’m sure bad at this blogging thing. Since I first set out in — technically, July 2013, but let’s say August — I’ve only gotten <em>one week</em> into my journey before hanging up. I’d like to see if I can try again, perhaps this time with a little more success.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this from Dublin, Ireland. In the interim, since my last entry from an actual city, I’ve visited Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans, Austin, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Paris, London, Cornwall, Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Prague, Berlin, Vienna, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Split, Bologna, Modena, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Turin — plus a number of smaller towns along the way. That’s more than a dozen different countries over the course of the past two years. To the person first setting out on this trip — the person who expected to arrive in London and cautiously venture to other countries only on rare occasion — this list would have been unimaginable. I was nervous. I’d never been alone in a place where the primary language wasn’t English. I wasn’t sure about the logistics. I didn’t even know if I’d be able to tinker with my projects in peace.</p>

        <p>When Apple replaced its Google-powered maps app with a complete in-house rewrite for iOS 6, most users had little good to say about it. It was inaccurate. It lacked public transit directions. The search was paltry, as was the iconography. At best, it could be described as <em>slick</em>, with the pixellated pop-in of previous generations replaced by crisp, swiftly scaling vector lines. But this was not enough to offset the lack of functionality compared to Google’s definitive mapping solution, and so <a href="https://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/">Tim Cook apologized</a> and we all went on with our lives.</p>

        <p>I recently released my first commercial project: <a href="http://translit-keyboard.archagon.net">Translit Keyboard</a>, a 3rd party keyboard for iPhone that lets you transliterate Latin characters into Cyrillic and some other alphabets. When I was first investigating this problem, around the time that iOS 7 came out, I discovered that I could implement an elegant solution in OSX using the lesser-known <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/Mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/InputMethodKitFrameworkRef/index.html">Input Method Kit</a>. My program sat between the keyboard and text field; the framework provided me with each raw character as it was entered, and I could either pass it along with the default behavior, or instead take control of the output and send off whatever I pleased<sup id="fnref:other_translit_techniques"></sup>. Sadly, iOS was off-limits: since 3rd party extensions weren’t even on the radar at the time, there was nothing anyone could do to enable this sort of behavior system-wide. The only solution was to make a nice app with a special text field that you could copy and paste from — too clunky for rapid-pace tasks like messaging.</p>

I was confused for a long time about what “assisted GPS” actually meant. My understanding was that it was impossible for an AGPS phone (which the iPhone is) to acquire a GPS signal without a data connection. Turns out it works fine — you just have to wait a bit longer for the phone to find a satellite.</p>

        <article class="section-content">
        <p>I recently ran into the following issue in my Objective-C code. Let’s say you have a model class<sup id="fnref:1"></sup> that has (among other things) an <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSMutableArray</code> of other model classes. How do you let outside objects modify this collection? One obvious solution is to add your own custom accessors: <code class="highlighter-rouge">addObject:</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">removeObject:</code>, and so forth. But that’s a little sad, since it’s essentially a simplified, non-standard duplicate of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSMutableArray</code> interface. The other obvious choice is to expose the array directly. But oh boy! If you do any pre- or post-processing on add or delete, there’s a world of pain waiting for you. It’s just not wise to let users mess around with the internals of your model like that. Maybe if <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSMutableArray</code> had a delegate, we could expose the array and then let the model object (as the delegate) have the final say on any changes, but sadly, to my knowledge, it does not. (<code class="highlighter-rouge">NSArrayController</code> on OSX and <code class="highlighter-rouge">CFArray</code> might have that functionality, but that’s just too much work for too little gain.) Finally, there’s the issue of key-value observation. How do we observe changes to the array? If we simply observe the array property, we’ll only get notifications when it’s set. Do we observe the array’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">count</code> property? (Doesn’t work, and wouldn’t handle replacement even if it did.) Do we add manual KVO calls to our custom accessors? Do we set a property somewhere whenever the array is modified?</p>

<p>It turns out there’s a solution to all these problems, and it involves something called key-value coding of collections.</p>

<p>So how’s programming on a cruise ship, anyway?</p>

<p>First of all, you can’t count on the internet out at sea. That’s not to say it’s unusable: I saw speeds as high as 15Mbit/sec down, though they usually hovered around 1Mbit/sec or less. (Ping was atrocious, of course.) However, at almost a dollar per minute during regular hours, it was hard to justify. One deal that my particular cruise offered was half-price internet from 11pm to 5am, giving me a rate of $0.37/minute. (This was actually better than most of the package deals and allowed me pay à la carte.) Having mentally allotted $50 for internet use, this meant that I could only use about 10 minutes per day, or 20 if I went once every 2 days. For the most part, I spent these periods rapidly opening a bunch of tabs to Gmail, Feedbin, and Hacker News, loading any new articles I needed since the last internet checkpoint, disconnecting to write any replies, and reconnecting one final time to send them out. It was basic, but it kept me content. (All logging in and logging out was done through an atrocious web interface, while the charges could be verified through an equally despicable account navigator on the cabin television.)</p>
