<p>A quiet day on the fifth floor of Sants, Barcelona.</p>
</div>

<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that if you’re doing the work-travel thing, you always need to have a reliable, quiet place nearby to retreat to. Most hostels just don’t offer that level of privacy, while hotels are too expensive. Coworking spaces would be great, except they cost an extra $10-$30 per day. (Except the gratis <a href="http://www.wixlounge.com/">Wix Lounge</a> in New York, but there’s no privacy there to speak of.)</p>

<p>Aside from finding rooms to rent or sublet (which can be tricky in a foreign country), the best solution I’ve been able to find so far is <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/c/ababoulevitch">Airbnb</a>. (Sign up with my referral link to earn us both credit, I think!) Per day, Airbnb listings tend to be roughly on par with hostels in terms of price; per month, they’re more expensive than the local rental rate, but not astronomically.<sup id="fnref:1"></sup> And for the extra cost, you get your own room (often with a window and desk), one or more locals to chat with, a fantastic communication and creditibility channel, and a neat little paper trail of all the places you’ve been to. Plus, you get to experience life in a foregin city as a local! If you’ve ever been to Europe, tell me you’ve never walked down the twisted cobblestone streets and wondered what life was like in those arborial, patchwork buildings…</p>

<p>Hello! I don’t know what happened. Sorry. I think I fell asleep for half a year. OK, I really need to put up the rest of my photos from my US trip. But before that…</p>

<p>I’m in Barcelona! And instead of flying, I took a ship.</p>

<p>I was originally thinking of crossing the Atlantic on a freighter, but <a href="http://tynan.com/cruisework">an article by a globetrotting programmer</a> pointed me to a somewhat more comfortable option: cruise ships. Wait, wait — before you think “how posh”, hear me out! As it turns out, during certain times of year, the big cruise lines ferry some of their ships across the Atlantic to prepare for their summer Mediterranean cruises. Since these sailings only go one way and happen during typically non-vacation times of the year, they are often very cheap. What’s more, the article pointed to these cruises as a fantastic way to get programming work done. Sure, internet is a no-go, but if you can get past that, you basically have an idyllic floating office (food service and hot tub included!) for a work week or two. Given my needs, it was a no-brainer.</p>

        </header>

        <article class="section-content">
        <p>I recently got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096VD85I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096VD85I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=arcwasher-20">high-end 15” Macbook Pro</a>. The 13” model I was using before had served me with faith and dignity over the years, but as my appetite for high-performance apps increased, the poor guy just couldn’t keep up like it used to. In the past, I would have only considered upgrading to another 13” laptop, but a lot has changed over the years. Computers have slimmed down. I’ve slimmed up. A 15” device just didn’t seem like the back-breaking monster it used to be.</p>

<p>The other big factor in my decision was graphics performance. Among all the Macbooks currently available, the high-end 15” Macbook Pro is the only one with a discrete graphics chip still inside. You get access to an integrated Intel Iris Pro 5200 for everyday use, but the OS can also switch you over to a powerful Nvidia 750m when the polygons have to fly.</p>

<p>At first, I naturally assumed that the 750m would kick the 5200’s butt; this was a separate ~40w component, after all. But as I started to dig through forum posts and benchmarks for my research, I discovered that while the Iris Pro usually lagged behind the 750m by 15%-50%, there were a few recorded instances where it matched or even surpassed the Nvidia chip! Some people blamed this on drivers, others on architecture. Were the numbers even accurate? I wanted to find out for myself.</p>

<p>There were a couple of specific questions I was looking to answer during my testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How good is the maximum graphics performance of this machine?</li>
  <li>How does the Iris Pro 5200 compare to the 750m?</li>
  <li>How does Windows 7 VM (Parallels) graphics performance compare to native Windows 7 (Bootcamp)?</li>
</ul>

        <p>A week into my Seattle visit, I moved from the downtown City Hostel to the confusingly-named <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-hotel-seattle">Hotel Hotel Hostel</a> in the Fremont neighborhood. (The very same neighborhood I had visited with my friends <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/10/14/seattle-of-lands-and-locals">a few days prior</a>.) The streets were quiet and a little quirky, the nearby water gently lapped at the shoreline, and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/theo-chocolate-seattle">smell of chocolate</a> followed you down the street. It felt a little like being on vacation. (Of course, having a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/brouwers-cafe-seattle">fantastic gastropub</a> down the street helped. Did I mention I hate the word “gastropub”? It sounds like somewhere you go to cleanse your body of toxins. But I digress…)</p>

        <p>I spent a couple of wonderful days in Seattle hanging out with an old friend, a new friend, and a baby.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/seattle-locals/peeps.jpg"></p>

<p>We met up a few times at my friend’s house for dinner and board games. The place was usually brimming with family and friends (great folks, the lot of them) as well as their children, who ran around and did whatever it is that children do. Looking back, I’ve spent a surprisingly small amount of time around kids ever since I was a kid myself, and it was inspiring to once again experience the kind of unreserved enthusiasm and curiosity that tends to fade as you get older. (One of them even asked if my camera was a Nikon!) I was also happy to see that the next generation of gamers was being raised by people with impeccable taste: Rayman Legends, Duck Tales, Fez.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to say enough good things about Seattle. You have the verdant scenery of the northwest; the familiar brick buildings and cobblestone streets; the twisting coastline of the Sound. There are the plentiful waterfront walks, the numerous indie eateries, the beautiful University of Washington campus, the hills and the hilltop views.  The people are nice and it’s not too crowded, even when you head to the more touristy parts of town.  Everything seems to be within walking distance — or a short bus ride away, at worst. Beer and coffee are consumed in copious amounts. And all this before the backdrop of the magnificent Mount Reinier, head high in the clouds.</p>

        <p>Sunday the 11th, 8:23pm — the day of my first departure. Having decided that Portland probably wasn’t worth a detour, I booked the Coast Starlight to Seattle, 24 hours by rail, along with another train from Vancouver to Toronto on the 23rd. (More on that later.) My station of departure was the San Jose Diridon. The train arrived a bit early, so I spent about an hour exploring the different cars and waving goodbye to my family. </p>

        <p>After living in a dark, enclosed space for a few years, I’ve decided to stretch my legs and travel around for a while. They say that routine makes your life pass by a lot faster. It certainly felt like the days were turning into months far too quickly at my previous job. Perhaps the secret to staying young forever, then, is simply a matter of taking in new experiences every day. Maybe it’ll be possible to get some of those months back while looking down from the Sears Tower (sorry, Willis), wandering around the streets of Barcelona, or taking in the neon lights of Tokyo. <a href="http://www.archagon.net/a-few-pointless-thoughts/2013/7/28/graphing-my-way-across-the-usa">I’m already a few weeks into a train trip around the United States and Canada</a>, and it’s been wonderful waking up to a new skyline every few days. I’m also working on a few apps and games on the side, leeching Wi-Fi from coffee shops and turning libraries into makeshift offices. With any luck, these projects will turn into a viable career at some point in the near future, and then — I will be able to truly call myself a digital nomad!</p>

        <p>I’ve been planning a trip around the United States for the past few weeks. I’ve got my bag, my clothes, my documents and even my <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/72">portable bucket</a>. Now all I need is… an itinerary? Rats!</p>

<p>Since this trip is intended to be a preliminary journey before I head off to more distant lands, I want to take most of it by train. It’ll be nice to see a fairly sizable portion of the country from the window. I might end up regretting it when I’m sitting in a 48-hour Amtrak car that’s delayed in the middle of the boonies, but hey, it’s better than refreshing MetaFilter or Hacker News for hours at a time.</p>

<p>I drew up my initial plan a few hours ago. Seeing as how I didn’t want to meticulously plan every detail of my drip ahead of time, I decided that a flow chart would be the best way to do it. (It’s like a choose your own adventure book in real life!) The best online tool I could find for this purpose was called <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com/">LucidChart</a>, by virtue of the fact that it featured automatic curved arrows. Free for personal use! Really cool.</p>

<p>Here’s the semi-finished map (click for larger):</p>
